      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the following pages I have endeavored to give the life of Abraham
      Lincoln, from his birth to his inauguration as President of the United
      States. The reader will judge the character of the performance by the work
      itself: for that reason I shall spare him the perusal of much prefatory
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of Mr. Lincoln's death, I determined to write his history, as
      I had in my possession much valuable material for such a purpose. I did
      not then imagine that any person could have better or more extensive
      materials than I possessed. I soon learned, however, that Mr. William H.
      Herndon of Springfield, Ill., was similarly engaged. There could be no
      rivalry between us; for the supreme object of both was to make the real
      history and character of Mr. Lincoln as well known to the public as they
      were to us. He deplored, as I did, the many publications pretending to be
      biographies which came teeming from the press, so long as the public
      interest about Mr. Lincoln excited the hope of gain. Out of the mass of
      works which appeared, of one only&mdash;Dr. Holland's&mdash;is it possible
      to speak with any degree of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1869, Mr. Herndon placed at my disposal his remarkable collection
      of materials,&mdash;the richest, rarest, and fullest collection it was
      possible to conceive. Along with them came an offer of hearty
      co-operation, of which I have availed myself so extensively, that no art
      of mine would serve to conceal it. Added to my own collections, these
      acquisitions have enabled me to do what could not have been done before,&mdash;prepare
      an authentic biography of Mr. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Herndon had been the partner in business and the intimate personal
      associate of Mr. Lincoln for something like a quarter of a century; and
      Mr. Lincoln had lived familiarly with several members of his family long
      before their individual acquaintance began. New Salem, Springfield, the
      old judicial circuit, the habits and friends of Mr. Lincoln, were as well
      known to Mr. Herndon as to himself. With these advantages, and from the
      numberless facts and hints which had dropped from Mr. Lincoln during the
      confidential intercourse of an ordinary lifetime, Mr. Herndon was able to
      institute a thorough system of inquiry for every noteworthy circumstance
      and every incident of value in Mr. Lincoln's career.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruits of Mr. Herndon's labors are garnered in three enormous volumes
      of original manuscripts and a mass of unarranged letters and papers. They
      comprise the recollections of Mr. Lincoln's nearest friends; of the
      surviving members of his family and his family-connections; of the men
      still living who knew him and his parents in Kentucky; of his
      schoolfellows, neighbors, and acquaintances in Indiana; of the better part
      of the whole population of New Salem; of his associates and relatives at
      Springfield; and of lawyers, judges, politicians, and statesmen
      everywhere, who had any thing of interest or moment to relate. They were
      collected at vast expense of time, labor, and money, involving the
      employment of many agents, long journeys, tedious examinations, and
      voluminous correspondence. Upon the value of these materials it would be
      impossible to place an estimate. That I have used them conscientiously and
      justly is the only merit to which I lay claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general thing, my text will be found to support itself; but whether
      the particular authority be mentioned or not, it is proper to remark, that
      each statement of fact is fully sustained by indisputable evidence
      remaining in my possession. My original plan was to verify every important
      statement by one or more appropriate citations; but it was early
      abandoned, not because it involved unwelcome labor, but because it
      encumbered my pages with a great array of obscure names, which the reader
      would probably pass unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dismiss this volume into the world, with no claim for it of literary
      excellence, but with the hope that it will prove what it purports to be,&mdash;a
      faithful record of the life of Abraham Lincoln down to the 4th of March,
      1861.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ABRAHAM LINCOLN was born on the twelfth day of February, 1809. His
      father's name was Thomas Lincoln, and his mother's maiden name was Nancy
      Hanks. At the time of his birth, they are supposed to have been married
      about three years. Although there appears to have been but little sympathy
      or affection between Thomas and Abraham Lincoln, they were nevertheless
      connected by ties and associations which make the previous history of
      Thomas Lincoln and his family a necessary part of any reasonably full
      biography of the great man who immortalized the name by wearing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Lincoln's ancestors were among the early settlers of Rockingham
      County in Virginia; but exactly whence they came, or the precise time of
      their settlement there, it is impossible to tell. They were manifestly of
      English descent; but whether emigrants directly from England to Virginia,
      or an offshoot of the historic Lincoln family in Massachusetts, or of the
      highly-respectable Lincoln family in Pennsylvania, are questions left
      entirely to conjecture. We have absolutely no evidence by which to
      determine them, Thomas Lincoln himself stoutly denied that his progenitors
      were either Quakers or Puritans; but he furnished nothing except his own
      word to sustain his denial: on the contrary, some of the family (distant
      relatives of Thomas Lincoln) who remain in Virginia believe themselves to
      have sprung from the New-England stock. They found their opinion solely on
      the fact that the Christian names given to the sons of the two families
      were the same, though only in a few cases, and at different times. But
      this might have arisen merely from that common religious sentiment which
      induces parents of a devotional turn to confer scriptural names on their
      children, or it might have been purely accidental. Abrahams, Isaacs, and
      Jacobs abound in many other families who claim no kindred on that account.
      In England, during the ascendency of the Puritans, in times of fanatical
      religious excitement, the children were almost universally baptized by the
      names of the patriarchs and Old-Testament heroes, or by names of their own
      pious invention, signifying what the infant was expected to do and to
      suffer in the cause of the Lord. The progenitors of all the American
      Lincolns were Englishmen, and they may have been Puritans. There is,
      therefore, nothing unreasonable in the supposition that they began the
      practice of conferring such names before the emigration of any of them;
      and the names, becoming matters of family pride and family tradition, have
      continued to be given ever since. But, if the fact that Christian names of
      a particular class prevailed among the Lincolns of Massachusetts and the
      Lincolns of Virginia at the same time is no proof of consanguinity, the
      identity of the surname is entitled to even less consideration. It is
      barely possible that they may have had a common ancestor; but, if they
      had, he must have lived and died so obscurely, and so long ago, that no
      trace of him can be discovered. It would be as difficult to prove a blood
      relationship between all the American Lincolns, as it would be to prove a
      general cousinship among all the Smiths or all the Joneses.1

        1 At the end of this volume will be found a very interesting account of
        the family, given by Mr. Lincoln himself. The original is in his own
        handwriting, and is here reproduced in fac-simile.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A patronymic so common as Lincoln, derived from a large geographical
      division of the old country, would almost certainly be taken by many who
      had no claim to it by reason of descent from its original possessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Holland, who, of all Mr. Lincoln's biographers, has entered most
      extensively into the genealogy of the family, says that the father of
      Thomas was named Abraham; but he gives no authority for his statement, and
      it is as likely to be wrong as to be right. The Hankses&mdash;John and
      Dennis&mdash;who passed a great part of their lives in the company of
      Thomas Lincoln, tell us that the name of his father was Mordecai; and so
      also does Col. Chapman, who married Thomas Lincoln's step-daughter. The
      rest of those who ought to know are unable to assign him any name at all.
      Dr. Holland says further, that this Abraham (or Mordecai) had four
      brothers,&mdash;Jacob, John, Isaac, and Thomas; that Isaac went to
      Tennessee, where his descendants are now; that Thomas went to Kentucky
      after his brother Abraham; but that Jacob and John "are supposed to have"
      remained in Virginia.1 This is doubtless true, at least so far as it
      relates to Jacob and John; for there are at this day numerous Lincolns
      residing in Rockingham County,&mdash;the place from which the Kentucky
      Lincolns emigrated. One of their ancestors, Jacob,&mdash;who seems to be
      the brother referred to,&mdash;was a lieutenant in the army of the
      Revolution, and present at the siege of Yorktown. His military services
      were made the ground of a claim against the government, and Abraham
      Lincoln, whilst a representative in Congress from Illinois, was applied to
      by the family to assist them in prosecuting it. A correspondence of some
      length ensued, by which the presumed relationship of the parties was fully
      acknowledged on both sides. But, unfortunately, no copy of it is now in
      existence. The one preserved by the Virginians was lost or destroyed
      during the late war. The family, with perfect unanimity, espoused the
      cause of the Confederate States, and suffered many losses in consequence,
      of which these interesting papers may have been one.

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Abraham (or Mordecai) the father of Thomas Lincoln, was the owner of a
      large and fertile tract of land on the waters of Linnville's Creek, about
      eight miles north of Harrisonburg, the court-house town of Rockingham
      County. It is difficult to ascertain the precise extent of this
      plantation, or the history of the title to it, inasmuch as all the records
      of the county were burnt by Gen. Hunter in 1864. It is clear, however,
      that it had been inherited by Lincoln, the emigrant to Kentucky, and that
      four, if not all, of his children were born upon it. At the time Gen.
      Sheridan received the order "to make the Valley of the Shenandoah a barren
      waste," this land was well improved and in a state of high cultivation;
      but under the operation of that order it was ravaged and desolated like
      the region around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln, the emigrant, had three sons and two daughters. Thomas was the
      third son and the fourth child. He was born in 1778; and in 1780, or a
      little later, his father removed with his entire family to Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kentucky was then the paradise of the borderer's dreams. Fabulous tales of
      its sylvan charms and pastoral beauties had for years been floating about,
      not only along the frontiers of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North
      Carolina, but farther back in the older settlements. For a while it had
      been known as the "Cane Country," and then as the "Country of Kentucky."
      Many expeditions were undertaken to explore it; two or three adventurers,
      and occasionally only one at a time, passing down the Ohio in canoes. But
      they all stopped short of the Kentucky River. The Indians were terrible;
      and it was known that they would surrender any other spot of earth in
      preference to Kentucky. The canes that were supposed to indicate the
      promised land&mdash;those canes of wondrous dimensions, that shot up, as
      thick as they could stand, from a soil of inestimable fertility&mdash;were
      forever receding before those who sought them. One party after another
      returned to report, that, after incredible dangers and hardships, they had
      met with no better fortune than that which had attended the efforts of
      their predecessors, and that they had utterly failed to find the "canes."
      At last they were actually found by Simon Kenton, who stealthily planted a
      little patch of corn, to see how the stalk that bore the yellow grain
      would grow beside its "brother" of the wilderness. He was one day leaning
      against the stem of a great tree, watching his little assemblage of
      sprouts, and wondering at the strange fruitfulness of the earth which fed
      them, when he heard a footstep behind him. It was the great Daniel
      Boone's. They united their fortunes for the present, but subsequently each
      of them became the chief of a considerable settlement. Kenton's trail had
      been down the Ohio, Boone's from North Carolina; and from both those
      directions soon came hunters, warriors, and settlers to join them. But the
      Indians had no thought of relinquishing their fairest hunting-grounds
      without a long and desperate struggle. The rich carpet of natural grasses
      which fed innumerable herds of buffalo, elk, and deer, all the year round;
      the grandeur of its primeval forests, its pure fountains, and abundant
      streams,&mdash;made it even more desirable to them than to the whites.
      They had long contended for the possession of it; and no tribe, or
      confederacy of tribes, had ever been able to hold it to the exclusion of
      the rest. Here, from time immemorial, the northern and southern, the
      eastern and western Indians had met each other in mortal strife, mutually
      shedding the blood which ought to have been husbanded for the more deadly
      conflict with a common foe. The character of this savage warfare had
      earned for Kentucky the appellation of "the dark and bloody ground;" and,
      now that the whites had fairly begun their encroachments upon it, the
      Indians were resolved that the phrase should lose none of its old
      significance. White settlers might therefore count upon fighting for their
      lives as well as their lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boone did not make his final settlement till 1775. The Lincolns came about
      1780. This was but a year or two after Clark's expedition into Illinois;
      and it was long, long before St. Clair's defeat and Wayne's victory.
      Nearly the whole of the north-west territory was then occupied by hostile
      Indians. Kentucky volunteers had yet before them many a day of hot and
      bloody work on the Ohio, the Muskingum, and the Miami, to say nothing of
      the continual surprises to which they were subjected at home. Every man's
      life was in his hand. From cabin to cabin, from settlement to settlement,
      his trail was dogged by the eager savage. If he went to plough, he was
      liable to be shot down between the handles; if he attempted to procure
      subsistence by hunting, he was hunted himself. Unless he abandoned his
      "clearing" and his stock to almost certain devastation, and shut up
      himself and his family in a narrow "fort," for months at a time, he might
      expect every hour that their roof would be given "to the flames, and their
      flesh to the eagles."
    </p>
    <p>
      To make matters worse, "the western country," and particularly Kentucky,
      had become the rendezvous of Tories, runaway conscripts, deserters,
      debtors, and criminals. Gen. Butler, who went there as a Commissioner from
      Congress, to treat with certain Indian tribes, kept a private journal, in
      which he entered a very graphic, but a very appalling description of the
      state of affairs in Kentucky. At the principal "points," as they were
      called, were collected hungry speculators, gamblers, and mere desperadoes,&mdash;these
      distinctions being the only divisions and degrees in society. Among other
      things, the journal contains a statement about land-jobbing and the
      traffic in town lots, at Louisville, beside which the account of the same
      business in "Martin Chuzzlewit" is absolutely tame. That city, now one of
      the most superb in the Union, was then a small collection of cabins and
      hovels, inhabited by a class of people of whom specimens might have been
      found a few months ago at Cheyenne or Promontory Point. Notwithstanding
      the high commissions borne by Gen. Butler and Gen. Parsons, the motley
      inhabitants of Louisville flatly refused even to notice them. They would
      probably have sold them a "corner lot" in a swamp, or a "splendid business
      site" in a mud-hole; but for mere civilities there was no time. The whole
      population were so deeply engaged in drinking, card-playing, and selling
      town lots to each other, that they persistently refused to pay any
      attention to three men who were drowning in the river near by, although
      their dismal cries for help were distinctly heard throughout the "city."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the journey out, the Lincolns are said to have endured many hardships
      and encountered all the usual dangers, including several skirmishes with
      the Indians. They settled in Mercer County, but at what particular spot is
      uncertain. Their house was a rough log-cabin, their farm a little clearing
      in the midst of a vast forest. One morning, not long after their
      settlement, the father took Thomas, his youngest son, and went to build a
      fence, a short distance from the house; while the other brothers, Mordecai
      and Josiah, were sent to another field, not far away. They were all intent
      about their work, when a shot from a party of Indians in ambush broke the
      "listening stillness" cf the woods. The father fell dead; Josiah ran to a
      stockade two or three miles off; Mordecai, the eldest boy, made his way to
      the house, and, looking out from the loophole in the loft, saw an Indian
      in the act of raising his little brother from the ground. He took
      deliberate aim at a silver ornament on the breast of the Indian, and
      brought him down. Thomas sprang toward the cabin, and was admitted by his
      mother, while Mordecai renewed his fire at several other Indians that rose
      from the covert of the fence or thicket. It was not long until Josiah
      returned from the stockade with a party of settlers; but the Indians had
      fled, and none were found but the dead one, and another who was wounded
      and had crept into the top of a fallen tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this tragedy was enacted, Mordecai, the hero of it, was a well-grown
      boy. He seems to have hated Indians ever after with a hatred which was
      singular for its intensity, even in those times. Many years afterwards,
      his neighbors believed that he was in the habit of following peaceable
      Indians, as they passed through the settlements, in order to get
      surreptitious shots at them; and it was no secret that he had killed more
      than one in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the death of her husband, the widow abandoned the scene
      of her misfortunes, and removed to Washington County, near the town of
      Springfield, where she lived until the youngest of her children had grown
      up. Mor-decai and Josiah remained there until late in life, and were
      always numbered among the best people in the neighborhood. Mordecai was
      the eldest son of his father; and under the law of primogeniture, which
      was still a part of the Virginia code, he inherited some estate in lands.
      One of the daughters wedded a Mr. Krume, and the other a Mr. Brumfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas seems to have been the only member of the family whose character
      was not entirely respectable. He was idle, thriftless, poor, a hunter, and
      a rover. One year he wandered away off to his uncle, on the Holston, near
      the confines of Tennessee. Another year he wandered into Breckinridge
      County, where his easy good-nature was overcome by a huge bully, and he
      performed the only remarkable achievement of his life, by whipping him. In
      1806, we find him in Hardin County, trying to learn the carpenter's trade.
      Until then, he could neither read nor write; and it was only after his
      marriage that his ambition led him to seek accomplishments of this sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Lincoln was not tall and thin, like Abraham, but comparatively
      short and stout, standing about five feet ten inches in his shoes. His
      hair was dark and coarse, his complexion brown, his face round and full,
      his eyes gray, and his nose large and prominent. He weighed, at different
      times, from one hundred and seventy to one hundred and ninety-six. He was
      built so "tight and compact," that Dennis Hanks declares he never could
      find the points of separation between his ribs, though he felt for them
      often. He was a little stoop-shouldered, and walked with a slow, halting
      step. But he was sinewy and brave, and, his habitually peaceable
      disposition once fairly overborne, was a tremendous man in a
      rough-and-tumble fight. He thrashed the monstrous bully of Breckinridge
      County in three minutes, and came off without a scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His vagrant career had supplied him with an inexhaustible fund of
      anecdotes, which he told cleverly and well. He loved to sit about at
      "stores," or under shade-trees, and "spin yarns,"&mdash;a propensity which
      atoned for many sins, and made him extremely popular. In politics, he was
      a Democrat,&mdash;a Jackson Democrat. In religion he was nothing at times,
      and a member of various denominations by turns,&mdash;a Free-Will Baptist
      in Kentucky, a Presbyterian in Indiana, and a Disciple&mdash;vulgarly
      called Campbellite&mdash;in Illinois. In this latter communion he seems to
      have died.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ought, perhaps, to be mentioned, that both in Virginia and Kentucky his
      name was commonly pronounced "Linck-horn," and in Indiana, "Linckhern."
      The usage was so general, that Tom Lincoln came very near losing his real
      name altogether. As he never wrote it at all until after his marriage, and
      wrote it then only mechanically, it was never spelled one way or the
      other, unless by a storekeeper here and there, who had a small account
      against him. Whether it was properly "Lincoln," "Linckhorn," or
      "Linckhern," was not definitely settled until after Abraham began to
      write, when, as one of the neighbors has it, "he remodelled the spelling
      and corrected the pronunciation."
    </p>
    <p>
      By the middle of 1806, Lincoln had acquired a very limited knowledge of
      the carpenter's trade, and set up on his own account; but his achievements
      in this line were no better than those of his previous life. He was
      employed occasionally to do rough work, that requires neither science nor
      skill; but nobody alleges that he ever built a house, or pretended to do
      more than a few little odd jobs connected with such an undertaking. He
      soon got tired of the business, as he did of every thing else that
      required application and labor. He was no boss, not even an average
      journeyman, nor a steady hand. When he worked at the trade at all, he
      liked to make common benches, cupboards, and bureaus; and some specimens
      of his work of this kind are still extant in Kentucky and Indiana, and
      bear their own testimony to the quality of their workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the year 1806 he married Nancy Hanks. It was in the shop of
      her uncle, Joseph Hanks, at Elizabethtown, in Hardin County, that he had
      essayed to learn the trade. We have no record of the courtship, but any
      one can readily imagine the numberless occasions that would bring together
      the niece and the apprentice. It is true that Nancy did not live with her
      uncle; but the Hankses were all very clannish, and she was doubtless a
      welcome and frequent guest at his house. It is admitted by all the old
      residents of the place that they were honestly married, but precisely when
      or how no one can tell. Diligent and thorough searches by the most
      competent persons have failed to discover any trace of the fact in the
      public records of Hardin and the adjoining counties. The license and the
      minister's return in the case of Lincoln and Sarah Johnston, his second
      wife, were easily found in the place where the law required them to be;
      but of Nancy Hanks's marriage there exists no evidence but that of mutual
      acknowledgment and cohabitation. At the time of their union, Thomas was
      twenty-eight years of age, and Nancy about twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln had previously courted a girl named Sally Bush, who lived in the
      neighborhood of Elizabethtown; but his suit was unsuccessful, and she
      became the wife of Johnston, the jailer. Her reason for rejecting Lincoln
      comes down to us in no words of her own; but it is clear enough that it
      was his want of character, and the "bad luck," as the Hankses have it,
      which always attended him. Sally Bush was a modest and pious girl, in all
      things pure and decent. She was very neat in her personal appearance, and,
      because she was particular in the selection of her gowns and company, had
      long been accounted a "proud body," who held her head above common folks.
      Even her own relatives seem to have participated in this mean accusation;
      and the decency of her dress and behavior appear to have made her an
      object of common envy and backbiting. But she had a will as well as
      principles of her own, and she lived to make them both serviceable to the
      neglected and destitute son of Nancy Hanks. Thomas Lincoln took another
      wife, but he always loved Sally Bush as much as he was capable of loving
      anybody; and years afterwards, when her husband and his wife were both
      dead, he returned suddenly from the wilds of Indiana, and, representing
      himself as a thriving and prosperous farmer, induced her to marry him. It
      will be seen hereafter what value was to be attached to his
      representations of his own prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy Hanks, who accepted the honor which Sally Bush refused, was a
      slender, symmetrical woman, of medium stature, a brunette, with dark hair,
      regular features, and soft, sparkling hazel eyes. Tenderly bred she might
      have been beautiful; but hard labor and hard usage bent her handsome form,
      and imparted an unnatural coarseness to her features long before the
      period of her death. Toward the close, her life and her face were equally
      sad; and the latter habitually wore the wo-ful expression which afterwards
      distinguished the countenance of her son in repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      By her family, her understanding was considered something wonderful. John
      Hanks spoke reverently of her "high and intellectual forehead," which he
      considered but the proper seat of faculties like hers. Compared with the
      mental poverty of her husband and relatives, her accomplishments were
      certainly very great; for it is related by them with pride and delight
      that she could actually read and write. The possession of these arts
      placed her far above her associates, and after a little while even Tom
      began to meditate upon the importance of acquiring them. He set to work
      accordingly, in real earnest, having a competent mistress so near at hand;
      and with much effort she taught him what letters composed his name, and
      how to put them together in a stiff and clumsy fashion. Henceforth he
      signed no more by making his mark; but it is nowhere stated that he ever
      learned to write any thing else, or to read either written or printed
      letters.

      Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Lucy Hanks. Her mother was one of four
      sisters,&mdash;Lucy, Betsy, Polly, and Nancy. Betsy married Thomas
      Sparrow; Polly married Jesse Friend, and Nancy, Levi Hall. Lucy became the
      wife of Henry Sparrow, and the mother of eight children. Nancy the younger
      was early sent to live with her uncle and aunt, Thomas and Betsy Sparrow.
      Nancy, another of the four sisters, was the mother of that Dennis F. Hanks
      whose name will be frequently met with in the course of this history. He
      also was brought up, or was permitted to come up, in the family of Thomas
      Sparrow, where Nancy found a shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Nancy became so completely identified with Thomas and Betsy Sparrow
      that many supposed her to have been their child. They reared her to
      womanhood, followed her to Indiana, dwelt under the same roof, died of the
      same disease, at nearly the same time, and were buried close beside her.
      They were the only parents she ever knew; and she must have called them by
      names appropriate to that relationship, for several persons who saw them
      die, and carried them to their graves, believe to this day that they were,
      in fact, her father and mother. Dennis Hanks persists even now in the
      assertion that her name was Sparrow; but Dennis was pitiably weak on the
      cross-examination: and we shall have to accept the testimony of Mr.
      Lincoln himself, and some dozens of other persons, to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that can be learned of that generation of Hankses to which Nancy's
      mother belonged has now been recorded as fully as is compatible with
      circumstances. They claim that their ancestors came from England to
      Virginia, whence they migrated to Kentucky with the Lincolns, and settled
      near them in Mercer County. The same, precisely, is affirmed of the
      Sparrows. Branches of both families maintained a more or less intimate
      connection with the fortunes of Thomas Lincoln, and the early life of
      Abraham was closely interwoven with theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln took Nancy to live in a shed on one of the alleys of
      Elizabethtown. It was a very sorry building, and nearly bare of furniture.
      It stands yet, or did stand in 1866, to witness for itself the wretched
      poverty of its early inmates. It is about fourteen feet square, has been
      three times removed, twice used as a slaughter-house, and once as a
      stable. Here a daughter was born on the tenth day of February, 1807, who
      was called Nancy during the life of her mother, and after her death Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lincoln soon wearied of Elizabethtown and carpenter-work. He thought
      he could do better as a farmer; and, shortly after the birth of Nancy (or
      Sarah), removed to a piece of land on the south fork of Nolin Creek, three
      miles from Hodgensville, within the present county of La Rue, and about
      thirteen miles from Elizabethtown. What estate he had, or attempted to
      get, in this land, is not clear from the papers at hand. It is said he
      bought it, but was unable to pay for it. It was very poor, and the
      landscape of which it formed a part was extremely desolate. It was then
      nearly destitute of timber, though it is now partially covered in spots by
      a young and stunted growth of post-oak and hickory. On every side the eye
      rested only upon weeds and low bushes, and a kind of grass which the
      present owner of the farm describes as "barren grass." It was, on the
      whole, as bad a piece of ground as there was in the neighborhood, and
      would hardly have sold for a dollar an acre. The general appearance of the
      surrounding country was not much better. A few small but pleasant streams&mdash;Nolin
      Creek and its tributaries&mdash;wandered through the valleys. The land was
      generally what is called "rolling;" that is, dead levels interspersed by
      little hillocks. Nearly all of it was arable; but, except the margins of
      the watercourses, not much of it was sufficiently fertile to repay the
      labor of tillage. It had no grand, un violated forests to allure the
      hunter, and no great bodies of deep and rich soils to tempt the
      husbandman. Here it was only by incessant labor and thrifty habits that an
      ordinary living could be wrung from the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family took up their residence in a miserable cabin, which stood on a
      little knoll in the midst of a barren glade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few stones tumbled down, and lying about loose, still indicate the site
      of the mean and narrow tenement which sheltered the infancy of one of the
      greatest political chieftains of modern times. Near by, a "romantic
      spring" gushed from beneath a rock, and sent forth a slender but silvery
      stream, meandering through those dull and unsightly plains. As it
      furnished almost the only pleasing feature in the melancholy desert
      through which it flowed, the place was called after it, "Rock Spring
      Farm." In addition to this single natural beauty, Lincoln began to think,
      in a little while, that a couple of trees would look well, and might even
      be useful, if judiciously planted in the vicinity of his bare house-yard.
      This enterprise he actually put into execution; and three decayed
      pear-trees, situated on the "edge" of what was lately a rye-field,
      constitute the only memorials of him or his family to be seen about the
      premises. They were his sole permanent improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that solitary cabin, on this desolate spot, the illustrious Abraham
      Lincoln was born on the twelfth day of February, 1809.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lincolns remained on Nolin Creek until Abraham was four years old.
      They then removed to a place much more picturesque, and of far greater
      fertility. It was situated about six miles from Hodgensville, on Knob
      Creek, a very clear stream, which took its rise in the gorges of Muldrews
      Hill, and fell into the Rolling Fork two miles above the present town of
      New Haven. The Rolling Fork emptied into Salt River, and Salt River into
      the Ohio, twenty-four miles below Louisville. This farm was well timbered,
      and more hilly than the one on Nolin Creek. It contained some rich
      valleys, which promised such excellent yields, that Lincoln bestirred
      himself most vigorously, and actually got into cultivation the whole of
      six acres, lying advantageously up and down the branch. This, however, was
      not all the work he did, for he still continued to pother occasionally at
      his trade; but, no matter what he turned his hand to, his gains were
      equally insignificant. He was satisfied with indifferent shelter, and a
      diet of "corn-bread and milk" was all he asked. John Hanks naively
      observes, that "happiness was the end of life with him." The land he now
      lived upon (two hundred and thirty-eight acres) he had pretended to buy
      from a Mr. Slater. The deed mentions a consideration of one hundred and
      eighteen pounds. The purchase must have been a mere speculation, with all
      the payments deferred, for the title remained in Lincoln but a single
      year. The deed was made to him Sept. 2, 1813; and Oct. 27, 1814, he
      conveyed two hundred acres to Charles Milton for one hundred pounds,
      leaving thirty-eight acres of the tract unsold. No public record discloses
      what he did with the remainder. If he retained any interest in it for-the
      time, it was probably permitted to be sold for taxes. The last of his
      voluntary transactions, in regard to this land, took place two years
      before his removal to Indiana; after which, he seems to have continued in
      possession as the tenant of Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, Dennis Hanks endeavored to initiate young Abraham, now
      approaching his eighth year, in the mysteries of fishing, and led him on
      numerous tramps up and down the picturesque branch,&mdash;the branch whose
      waters were so pure that a white pebble could be seen in a depth of ten
      feet. On Nolin he had hunted ground-hogs with an older boy, who has since
      become the Rev. John Duncan, and betrayed a precocious zest in the sport.
      On Knob Creek, he dabbled in the water, or roved the hills and climbed the
      trees, with a little companion named Gallaher. On one occasion, when
      attempting to "coon" across the stream, by swinging over on a
      sycamore-tree, Abraham lost his hold, and, tumbling into deep water, was
      saved only by the utmost exertions of the other boy. But, with all this
      play, the child was often serious and sad. With the earliest dawn of
      reason, he began to suffer and endure; and it was that peculiar moral
      training which developed both his heart and his intellect with such
      singular and astonishing rapidity. It is not likely that Tom Lincoln cared
      a straw about his education. He had none himself, and is said to have
      admired "muscle" more than mind. Nevertheless, as Abraham's sister was
      going to school for a few days at a time, he was sent along, as Dennis
      Hanks remarks, more to bear her company than with any expectation or
      desire that he would learn much himself. One of the masters, Zachariah
      Riney, taught near the Lincoln cabin. The other, Caleb Hazel, kept his
      school nearly four miles away, on the "Friend" farm; and the hapless
      children were compelled to trudge that long and weary distance with
      spelling-book and "dinner,"&mdash;the latter a lunch of corn-bread, Tom
      Lincoln's favorite dish. Hazel could teach reading and writing, after a
      fashion, and a little arithmetic. But his great qualification for his
      office lay in the strength of his arm, and his power and readiness to
      "whip the big boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as time wore on, the infelicities of Lincoln's life in this
      neighborhood became insupportable. He was gaining neither riches nor
      credit; and, being a wanderer by natural inclination, began to long for a
      change. His decision, however, was hastened by certain troubles which
      culminated in a desperate combat between him and one Abraham Enlow. They
      fought like savages; but Lincoln obtained a signal and permanent advantage
      by biting off the nose of his antagonist, so that he went bereft all the
      days of his life, and published his audacity and its punishment wherever
      he showed his face. But the affray, and the fame of it, made Lincoln more
      anxious than ever to escape from Kentucky. He resolved, therefore, to
      leave these scenes forever, and seek a roof-tree beyond the Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has pleased some of Mr. Lincoln's biographers to represent this removal
      of his father as a flight from the taint of slavery. Nothing could be
      further from the truth. There were not at the time more than fifty slaves
      in all Hardin County, which then composed a vast area of territory. It was
      practically a free community. Lincoln's more fortunate relatives in other
      parts of the State were slaveholders; and there is not the slightest
      evidence that he ever disclosed any conscientious scruples concerning the
      "institution."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lives of his father and mother, and the history and character of the
      family before their settlement in Indiana, were topics upon which Mr.
      Lincoln never spoke but with great reluctance and significant reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his family Bible he kept a register of births, marriages, and deaths,
      every entry being carefully made in his own handwriting. It contains the
      date of his sister's birth and his own; of the marriage and death of his
      sister; of the death of his mother; and of the birth and death of Thomas
      Lincoln. The rest of the record is almost wholly devoted to the Johnstons
      and their numerous descendants and connections. It has not a word about
      the Hankses or the Sparrows. It shows the marriage of Sally Bush, first
      with Daniel Johnston, and then with Thomas Lincoln; but it is entirely
      silent as to the marriage of his own mother. It does not even give the
      date of her birth, but barely recognizes her existence and demise, to make
      the vacancy which was speedily filled by Sarah Johnston.1

      An artist was painting his portrait, and asked him for a sketch of his
      early life. He gave him this brief memorandum: "I was born Feb. 12,1809,
      in the then Hardin County, Kentucky, at a point within the now county of
      La Rue, a mile or a mile and a half from where Hodgens Mill now is. My
      parents being dead, and my own memory not serving, I know of no means of
      identifying the precise locality. It was on Nolin Creek."

      To the compiler of the "Dictionary of Congress" he gave the following:
      "Born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. Education defective.
      Profession, a lawyer. Have been a captain of volunteers in the Black-Hawk
      War. Postmaster at a very small office. Four times a member of the
      Illinois Legislature, and was a member of the Lower House of Congress."

      "The chief difficulty I had to encounter," writes this latter gentleman,
      "was to induce him to communicate the homely facts and incidents of his
      early life. He seemed to be painfully impressed with the extreme poverty
      of his early surroundings, the utter absence of all romantic and heroic
      elements; and I know he thought poorly of the idea of attempting a
      biographical sketch for campaign purposes.... Mr. Lincoln communicated
      some facts to me about his ancestry, which he did not wish published, and
      which I have never spoken of or alluded to before. I do not think,
      however, that Dennis Hanks, if he knows any thing about these matters,
      would be very likely to say any thing about them."

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THOMAS LINCOLN was something of a waterman. In the frequent changes of
      occupation, which had hitherto made his life so barren of good results, he
      could not resist the temptation to the career of a flat-boatman. He had
      accordingly made one, or perhaps two trips to New Orleans, in the company
      and employment of Isaac Bush, who was probably a near relative of Sally
      Bush. It was therefore very natural, that when, in the fall of 1816, he
      finally determined to emigrate, he should attempt to transport his goods
      by water. He built himself a boat, which seems to have been none of the
      best, and launched it on the Rolling Fork, at the mouth of Knob Creek, a
      half-mile from his cabin. Some of his personal property, including
      carpenter's tools, he put on board, and the rest he traded for four
      hundred gallons of whiskey. With this crazy boat and this singular cargo,
      he put out into the stream alone, and floating with the current down the
      Rolling Fork, and then down Salt River, reached the Ohio without any
      mishap. Here his craft proved somewhat rickety when contending with the
      difficulties of the larger stream, or perhaps there was a lack of force in
      the management of her, or perhaps the single navigator had consoled
      himself during the lonely voyage by too frequent applications to a portion
      of his cargo: at all events, the boat capsized, and the lading went to the
      bottom. He fished up a few of the tools "and most of the whiskey," and,
      righting the little boat, again floated down to a landing at Thompson's
      Ferry, two and a half miles west of Troy, in Perry County, Indiana. Here
      he sold his treacherous boat, and, leaving his remaining property in the
      care of a settler named Posey, trudged off on foot to select "a location"
      in the wilderness. He did not go far, but found a place that he thought
      would suit him only sixteen miles distant from the river. He then turned
      about, and walked all the way back to Knob Creek, in Kentucky, where he
      took a fresh start with his wife and her children. Of the latter there
      were only two,&mdash;Nancy (or Sarah), nine years of age, and Abraham,
      seven. Mrs. Lincoln had given birth to another son some years before, but
      he had died when only three days old. After leaving Kentucky, she had no
      more children.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Lincoln loaded what little he had left upon two horses, and
      "packed through to Posey's." Besides clothing and bedding, they carried
      such cooking utensils as would be needed by the way, and would be
      indispensable when they reached their destination. The stock was not
      large. It consisted of "one oven and lid, one skillet and lid, and some
      tin-ware." They camped out during the nights, and of course cooked their
      own food. Lincoln's skill as a hunter must now have stood him in good
      stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where he got the horses used upon this occasion, it is impossible to say;
      but they were likely borrowed from his brother-in-law, Krume, of
      Breckinridge County, who owned such stock, and subsequently moved Sarah
      Johnston's goods to Indiana, after her marriage with Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to Posey's, Lincoln hired a wagon, and, loading on it the
      whiskey and other things he had stored there, went on toward the place
      which has since become famous as the "Lincoln Farm." He was now making his
      way through an almost untrodden wilderness. There was no road, and for a
      part of the distance not even a foot-trail. He was slightly assisted by a
      path of a few miles in length, which had been "blazed out" by an earlier
      settler named Hoskins. But he was obliged to suffer long delays, and cut
      out a passage for the wagon with his axe. At length, after many detentions
      and difficulties he reached the point where he intended to make his future
      home. It was situated between the forks of Big Pigeon and Little Pigeon
      Creeks, a mile and a half east of Gentryville, a village which grew up
      afterwards, and now numbers about three hundred inhabitants. The whole
      country was covered with a dense forest of oaks, beeches, walnuts,
      sugar-maples, and nearly all the varieties of trees that flourish in North
      America. The woods were usually open, and devoid of underbrush; the trees
      were of the largest growth, and beneath the deep shades they afforded was
      spread out a rich greensward. The natural grazing was very good, and hogs
      found abundant sustenance in the prodigious quantity of mast. There was
      occasionally a little glade or prairie set down in the midst of this vast
      expanse of forest. One of these, not far from the Lincoln place, was a
      famous resort for the deer, and the hunters knew it well for its numerous
      "licks." Upon this prairie the militia "musters" were had at a later day,
      and from it the south fork of the Pigeon came finally to be known as the
      "Prairie Fork."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln laid off his curtilage on a gentle hillock having a slope on every
      side. The spot was very beautiful, and the soil was excellent. The
      selection was wise in every respect but one. There was no water near,
      except what was collected in holes in the ground after a rain; but it was
      very foul, and had to be strained before using. At a later period we find
      Abraham and his step-sister carrying water from a spring situated a mile
      away. Dennis Hanks asserts that Tom Lincoln "riddled his land like a
      honeycomb," in search of good water, and was at last sorely tempted to
      employ a Yankee, who came around with a divining-rod, and declared that
      for the small consideration of five dollars in cash, he would make his rod
      point to a cool, flowing spring beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Lincoln built "a half-faced camp,"&mdash;a cabin enclosed on three
      sides and open on the fourth. It was built, not of logs, but of poles, and
      was therefore denominated a "camp," to distinguish it from a "cabin." It
      was about fourteen feet square, and had no floor. It was no larger than
      the first house he lived in at Elizabethtown, and on the whole not as good
      a shelter. But Lincoln was now under the influence of a transient access
      of ambition, and the camp was merely preliminary to something better. He
      lived in it, however, for a whole year, before he attained to the dignity
      of a residence in a cabin. "In the mean time he cleaned some land, and
      raised a small crop of corn and vegetables."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall of 1817, Thomas and Betsy Sparrow came out from Kentucky, and
      took up their abode in the old camp which the Lincolns had just deserted
      for the cabin. Betsy was the aunt who had raised Nancy Hanks. She had done
      the same in part for our friend Dennis Hanks, who was the offspring of
      another sister, and she now brought him with her. Dennis thus became the
      constant companion of young Abraham; and all the other members of that
      family, as originally settled in Indiana, being dead, Dennis remains a
      most important witness as to this period of Mr. Lincoln's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln's second house was a "rough, rough log" one: the timbers were not
      hewed; and until after the arrival of Sally Bush, in 1819, it had neither
      floor, door, nor window. It stood about forty yards from what Dennis Hanks
      calls that "darned little half-faced camp," which was now the dwelling of
      the Sparrows. It was "right in the bush,"&mdash;in the heart of a virgin
      wilderness. There were only seven or eight older settlers in the
      neighborhood of the two Pigeon Creeks. Lincoln had had some previous
      acquaintance with one of them,&mdash;a Mr. Thomas Carter; and it is highly
      probable that nothing but this trivial circumstance induced him to settle
      here.1

        1 The principal authorities for this part of our narrative are

      The nearest town was Troy, situated on the Ohio, about half a mile from
      the mouth of Anderson Creek. Gentryville had as yet no existence.
      Travelling was on horseback or on foot, and the only resort of commerce
      was to the pack-horse or the canoe. But a prodigious immigration was now
      sweeping into this inviting country. Harrison's victories over the Indians
      had opened it up to the peaceful settler; and Indiana was admitted into
      the Union in 1816, with a population of sixty-five thousand. The county in
      which Thomas Lincoln settled was Perry, with the county-seat at Troy; but
      he soon found himself in the new county of Spencer, with the court-house
      at Rockport, twenty miles south of him, and the thriving village of
      Gentryville within a mile and a half of his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A post-office was established at Gentryville in 1824 or 1825. Dennis Hanks
      helped to hew the logs used to build the first storeroom. The following
      letter from Mr. David Turnham, now of Dale, Spencer County, presents some
      interesting and perfectly authentic information regarding the village and
      the settlements around it in those early times:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours of the 5th inst. is at hand. As you wish me to answer several
      questions, I will give you a few items of the early settlement of Indiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my father came here in the spring of 1819, he settled in Spencer
      County, within one mile of Thomas Lincoln, then a widower. The chance for
      schooling was poor; but, such as it was, Abraham and myself attended the
      same schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We first had to go seven miles to mill; and then it was a hand-mill that
      would grind from ten to fifteen bushels of corn in a day. There was but
      little wheat grown at that time; and, when we did have wheat, we had to
      grind it on the mill described, and use it without bolting, as there were
      no bolts in the country. In the course of two or three years, a man by the
      name of Huffman built a mill on Anderson River, about twelve miles
      distant. Abe and I had to do the milling on horseback, frequently going
      twice to get one grist. Then they began building horse-mills of a little
      better quality than the hand-mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The country was very rough, especially in the low lands, so thick with
      bush that a man could scarcely get through on foot. These places were
      called Roughs. The country abounded in game, such as bears, deer, turkeys,
      and the smaller game.

      "About the time Huffman built his mill, there was a road laid out from
      Corydon to Evansville, running by Mr. Lincoln's farm, and through what is
      now Gentryville. Corydon was then the State capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the year 1823, there was another road laid out from Rockport to
      Bloomington, crossing the aforesaid at right angles, where Gentryville now
      stands. James Gentry entered the land; and in about a year Gideon Romine
      brought goods there, and shortly after succeeded in getting a post-office,
      by the name of Gentryville Post-office. Then followed the laying out of
      lots, and the selling of them, and a few were improved. But for some cause
      the lots all fell back to the original owner. The lots were sold in 1824
      or 1825. Romine kept goods there a short time, and sold out to Gentry, but
      the place kept on increasing slowly. William Jones came in with a store,
      that made it improve a little faster, but Gentry bought him out. Jones
      bought a tract of land one-half mile from Gentryville, moved to it, went
      into business there, and drew nearly all the custom. Gentry saw that it
      was ruining his town: he compromised with Jones, and got him back to
      Gentryville; and about the year 1847 or 1848 there was another survey of
      lots, which remains.

      "This is as good a history of the rise of Gentryville as I can give, after
      consulting several of the old settlers.

      "At that time there were a great many deer-licks; and Abe and myself would
      go to those licks sometimes, and watch of nights to kill deer, though Abe
      was not so fond of a gun as I was. There were ten or twelve of these licks
      in a small prairie on the creek, lying between Mr. Lincoln's and Mr.
      Wood's (the man you call Moore). This gave it the name of Prairie Fork of
      Pigeon Creek.

      "The people in the first settling of this country were very sociable,
      kind, and accommodating; but there was more drunkenness and stealing on a
      small scale, more immorality, less religion, less well-placed confidence."

      The steps taken by Lincoln to complete his title to the land upon which he
      settled are thus recited by the Commissioner of the General Land Office:&mdash;

      "In reply to the letter of Mr. W. H. Herndon, who is writing the biography
      of the late President, dated June 19, 1865, herewith returned, I have the
      honor to state, pursuant to the Secretary's reference, that on the 15th of
      October, 1817, Mr. Thomas Lincoln, then of Perry County, Indiana, entered
      under the old credit system,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. The South-West Quarter of Section 82, in Township 4, South of Range 5
      West, lying in Spencer County, Indiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. Afterwards the said Thomas Lincoln relinquished to the United States
      the East half of said South-West Quarter; and the amount paid thereon was
      passed to his credit to complete payment of the West half of said
      South-West Quarter of Section 32, in Township 4, South of Range 5 West;
      and accordingly a patent was issued to said Thomas Lincoln for the latter
      tract. The patent was dated June 6, 1827, and was signed by John Quincy
      Adams, then President of the United States, and countersigned by George
      Graham, then Commissioner of the General Land Office." 1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 The patent was issued to Thomas Lincoln alias Linckhern the other half
        he never paid, and finally lost the whole of the land.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It will be observed, that, although Lincoln squatted upon the land in the
      fall of 1816, he did not enter it until October of the next year; and that
      the patent was not issued to him until June, 1827, but a little more than
      a year before he left it altogether. Beginning by entering a full quarter
      section, he was afterwards content with eighty acres, and took eleven
      years to make the necessary payments upon that. It is very probable that
      the money which finally secured the patent was furnished by Gentry or
      Aaron Grigsby, and the title passed out of Lincoln in the course of the
      transaction. Dennis Hanks says, "He settled on a piece of government land,&mdash;eighty
      acres. This land he afterwards bought under the Two-Dollar Act; was to pay
      for it in instalments; one-half he paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      For two years Lincoln continued to live along in the old way. He did not
      like to farm, and he never got much of his land under cultivation. His
      principal crop was corn; and this, with the game which a rifleman so
      expert would easily take from the woods around him, supplied his table. It
      does not appear that he employed any of his mechanical skill in completing
      and furnishing his own cabin. It has already been stated that the latter
      had no window, door, or floor. But the furniture&mdash;if it may be called
      furniture&mdash;was even worse than the house. Three-legged stools served
      for chairs. A bedstead was made of poles stuck in the cracks of the logs
      in one corner of the cabin, while the other end rested in the crotch of a
      forked stick sunk in the earthen floor. On these were laid some boards,
      and on the boards a "shake-down" of leaves covered with skins and old
      petticoats. The table was a hewed puncheon, supported by four legs. They
      had a few pewter and tin dishes to eat from, but the most minute inventory
      of their effects makes no mention of knives or forks. Their cooking
      utensils were a Dutch oven and a skillet. Abraham slept in the loft, to
      which he ascended by means of pins driven into holes in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1818, the Pigeon-Creek settlements were visited by a
      fearful disease, called, in common parlance, "the milk-sickness." It swept
      off the cattle which gave the milk, as well as the human beings who drank
      it. It seems to have prevailed in the neighborhood from 1818 to 1829; for
      it is given as one of the reasons for Thomas Lincoln's removal to Illinois
      at the latter date. But in the year first mentioned its ravages were
      especially awful. Its most immediate effects were severe retchings and
      vomitings; and, while the deaths from it were not necessarily sudden, the
      proportion of those who finally died was uncommonly large.1 Among the
      number who were attacked by it, and lingered on for some time in the midst
      of great sufferings, were Thomas and Betsy Sparrow and Mrs. Nancy Lincoln.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 The peculiar disease which carried off so many of Abraham's family,
        and induced the removal of the remainder to Illinois, deserves more than
        a passing allusion. The following, regarding its nature and treatment,
        is from the pen of an eminent physician of Danville, Illinois:&mdash;
        Ward H. Lamon, Esq. Dear Sir,&mdash;Your favor of the 17th inst. has
        been received. You request me to present you with my theory in relation
        to the origin of the disease called "milk-sickness," and also a "general
        statement of the best treatment of the disease," and the proportion of
        fatal cases. I have quite a number of cases of the so-called disease in
        Danville, Ill., and its vicinity; but perhaps you are not aware, that,
        between the great majority of the medical faculty in this region of
        country and myself, there is quite a discrepancy of opinion. They
        believe in the existence of the disease in Vermilion County; while, on
        the contrary, I am firmly of opinion, that, instead of genuine milk-
        sickness, it is only a modified form of malarial fever with which we
        here have to contend. Though sceptical of its existence in this part of
        the country, we have too much evidence from different intelligent
        sources to doubt, for a moment, that, in many parts of the West and
        South-west, there is a distinct malady, witnessed more than fifty years
        ago, and different from every other heretofore recognized in any system
        of Nosology. In the opinion of medical men, as well as in that of the
        people in general, where milk-sickness prevails, cattle, sheep, and
        horses contract the disease by feeding on wild pasture-lands; and, when
        those pastures have been enclosed and cultivated, the cause entirely
        disappears. This has also been the observation of the farmers and
        physicians of Vermilion County, Illinois. From this it might be inferred
        that the disease had a vegetable origin. But it appears that it prevails
        as early in the season as March and April in some localities; and I am
        informed that, in an early day, say thirty-five or forty years ago, it
        showed itself in the winter-time in this county. This seems to argue
        that it may be produced by water holding some mineral substance in
        solution. Even in this case, however, some vegetable producing the
        disease may have been gathered and preserved with the hay on which the
        cattle were fed at the time; for in that early day the farmers were in
        the habit of cutting wild grass for their stock. On the whole, I am
        inclined to attribute the cause to a vegetable origin. The symptoms of
        what is called milk-sickness in this county&mdash; and they are similar
        to those described by authors who have written on the disease in other
        sections of the Western country&mdash;are a whitish coat on the tongue,
        burning sensation of the stomach severe vomiting, obstinate constipation
        of the bowels, coolness of the extremities, great restlessness and
        jactitation, pulse rather small, somewhat more frequent than natural,
        and slightly corded. In the course of the disease, the coat on the
        tongue becomes brownish and dark, the countenance dejected, and the
        prostration of the patient is great. A fatal termination may take place
        in sixty hours, or life may be prolonged for a period of fourteen days.
        These are the symptoms of the acute form of the disease. Sometimes it
        runs into the chronic form, or it may assume that form from the
        commencement; and, after months or years, the patient may finally die,
        or recover only a partial degree of health. The treatment which I have
        found most successful is pills composed of calomel and opium, given at
        intervals of two, three, or four hours, so as to bring the patient
        pretty strongly under the influence of opium by the time the second or
        third dose had been administered; some effervescing mixture, pro re
        nata; injections; castor oil, when the stomach will retain it; blisters
        to the stomach; brandy or good whiskey freely administered throughout
        the disease; and quinine after the bowels have been moved. Under the
        above treatment, modified according to the circumstances, I would not
        expect to lose more than one case in eight or ten, as the disease
        manifests itself in this county.... As ever, Theo. Lemon.

      It was now found expedient to remove the Sparrows from the wretched
      "half-faced camp," through which the cold autumn winds could sweep almost
      unobstructed, to the cabin of the Lincolns, which in truth was then very
      little better. Many in the neighborhood had already died, and Thomas
      Lincoln had made all their coffins out of "green lumber cut with a
      whip-saw." In the mean time the Sparrows and Nancy were growing alarmingly
      worse. There was no physician in the county,&mdash;not even a pretender to
      the science of medicine; and the nearest regular practitioner was located
      at Yellow Banks, Ky., over thirty miles distant. It is not probable that
      they ever secured his services. They would have been too costly, and none
      of the persons who witnessed and describe these scenes speak of his having
      been there. At length, in the first days of October, the Sparrows died;
      and Thomas Lincoln sawed up his green lumber, and made rough boxes to
      enclose the mortal remains of his wife's two best and oldest friends. A
      day or two after, on the 5th of October, 1818, Nancy Hanks Lincoln rested
      from her troubles. Thomas Lincoln took to his green wood again, and made a
      box for Nancy. There were about twenty persons at her funeral. They took
      her to the summit of a deeply-wooded knoll, about half a mile south-east
      of the cabin, and laid her beside the Sparrows. If there were any burial
      ceremonies, they were of the briefest. But it happened that a few months
      later an itinerant preacher, named David Elkin, whom the Lincolns had
      known in Kentucky, wandered into the settlement; and he either volunteered
      or was employed to preach a sermon, which should commemorate the many
      virtues and pass in silence the few frailties of the poor woman who slept
      in the forest. Many years later the bodies of Levi Hall and his wife,
      Nancy Hanks, were deposited in the same earth with that of Mrs. Lincoln.
      The graves of two or three children belonging to a neighbor's family are
      also near theirs. They are all crumbled in, sunken, and covered with wild
      vines in deep and tangled mats. The great trees were originally cut away
      to make a small cleared space for this primitive graveyard; but the young
      dogwoods have sprung up unopposed in great luxuriance, and in many
      instances the names of pilgrims to the burial-place of the great Abraham
      Lincoln's mother are carved in their bark. With this exception, the spot
      is wholly unmarked. Her grave never had a stone, nor even a board, at its
      head or its foot; and the neighbors still dispute as to which one of those
      unsightly hollows contains the ashes of Nancy Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen months after the burial of Nancy Hanks, and nine or ten months
      after the solemnities conducted by Elkin, Thomas Lincoln appeared at
      Elizabethtown, Ky., in search of another wife. Sally Bush had married
      Johnston, the jailer, in the spring of the same year in which Lincoln had
      married Nancy Hanks. She had then rejected him for a better match, but was
      now a widow. In 1814 many persons in and about Elizabethtown had died of a
      disease which the people called the "cold plague," and among them the
      jailer. Both parties being free again, Lincoln came back, very
      unexpectedly to Mrs. Johnston, and opened his suit in an exceedingly
      abrupt manner. "Well, Miss Johnston," said he, "I have no wife, and you
      have no husband. I came a purpose to marry you: I knowed you from a gal,
      and you knowed me from a boy. I have no time to lose; and, if you are
      willin', let it be done straight off." To this she replied, "Tommy, I know
      you well, and have no objection to marrying you; but I cannot do it
      straight off, as I owe some debts that must first be paid." "The next
      morning," says Hon. Samuel Haycraft, the clerk of the courts and the
      gentleman who reports this quaint courtship, "I issued his license, and
      they were married <i>straight</i> off on that day, and left, and I never
      saw her or Tom Lincoln since." From the death of her husband to that day,
      she had been living, "an honest, poor widow," "in a round log-cabin,"
      which stood in an "alley" just below Mr. Haycraft's house. Dennis Hanks
      says that it was only "on the earnest solicitation of her friends" that
      Mrs. Johnston consented to marry Lincoln. They all liked Lincoln, and it
      was with a member of her family that he had made several voyages to New
      Orleans. Mr. Helm, who at that time was doing business in his uncle's
      store at Elizabethtown, remarks that "life among the Hankses, the
      Lincolns, and the Enlows was a long ways below life among the Bushes."
      Sally was the best and the proudest of the Bushes; but, nevertheless, she
      appears to have maintained some intercourse with the Lincolns as long as
      they remained in Kentucky. She had a particular kindness for little Abe,
      and had him with her on several occasions at Helm's store, where, strange
      to say, he sat on a nail-keg, and ate a lump of sugar, "just like any
      other boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Johnston has been denominated a "poor widow;" but she possessed
      goods, which, in the eyes of Tom Lincoln, were of almost unparalleled
      magnificence. Among other things, she had a bureau that cost forty
      dollars; and he informed her, on their arrival in Indiana, that, in his
      deliberate opinion, it was little less than sinful to be the owner of such
      a thing. He demanded that she should turn it into cash, which she
      positively refused to do. She had quite a lot of other articles, however,
      which he thought well enough in their way, and some of which were sadly
      needed in his miserable cabin in the wilds of Indiana. Dennis Hanks speaks
      with great rapture of the "large supply of household goods" which she
      brought out with her. There was "one fine bureau, one table, one set of
      chairs, one large clothes-chest, cooking utensils, knives, forks, bedding,
      and other articles." It was a glorious day for little Abe and Sarah and
      Dennis when this wondrous collection of rich furniture arrived in the
      Pigeon Creek settlement. But all this wealth required extraordinary means
      of transportation; and Lincoln had recourse to his brother-in-law, Ralph
      Krume, who lived just over the line, in Breckinridge County. Krume came
      with a four-horse team, and moved Mrs. Johnston, now Mrs. Lincoln, with
      her family and effects, to the home of her new husband in Indiana. When
      she got there, Mrs. Lincoln was much "surprised" at the contrast between
      the glowing representations which her husband had made to her before
      leaving Kentucky and the real poverty and meanness of the place. She had
      evidently been given to understand that the bridegroom had reformed his
      old Kentucky ways, and was now an industrious and prosperous farmer. She
      was scarcely able to restrain the expression of her astonishment and
      discontent; but, though sadly overreached in a bad bargain, her lofty
      pride and her high sense of Christian duty saved her from hopeless and
      useless repinings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, she set about mending what was amiss with all her
      strength and energy. Her own goods furnished the cabin with tolerable
      decency. She made Lincoln put down a floor, and hang windows and doors. It
      was in the depth of winter; and the children, as they nestled in the warm
      beds she provided them, enjoying the strange luxury of security from the
      cold winds of December, must have thanked her from the bottoms of their
      newly-comforted hearts. She had brought a son and two daughters of her
      own,&mdash;John, Sarah, and Matilda; but Abe and his sister Nancy (whose
      name was speedily changed to Sarah), the ragged and hapless little
      strangers to her blood, were given an equal place in her affections. They
      were half naked, and she clad them from the stores of clothing she had
      laid up for her own. They were dirty, and she washed them; they had been
      ill-used, and she treated them with motherly tenderness. In her own modest
      language, she "made them look a little more human." "In fact," says Dennis
      Hanks, "in a few weeks all had changed; and where every thing was wanting,
      now all was snug and comfortable. She was a woman of great energy of
      remarkable good sense, very industrious and saving, and also very neat and
      tidy in her person and manners, and knew exactly how to manage children.
      She took an especial liking to young Abe. Her love for him was warmly
      returned, and continued to the day of his death. But few children loved
      their parents as he loved his step-mother. She soon dressed him up in
      entire new clothes, <i>and from that time on he appeared to lead a new
      life</i>. He was encouraged by her to study, and any wish on his part was
      gratified when it could be done. The two sets of children got along finely
      together, as if they had all been the children of the same parents. Mrs.
      Lincoln soon discovered that young Abe was a boy of uncommon natural
      talents, and that, if rightly trained, a bright future was before him, and
      she did all in her power to develop those talents." When, in after years,
      Mr. Lincoln spoke of his "saintly mother," and of his "angel of a mother,"
      he referred to this noble woman,1 who first made him feel "like a human
      being,"&mdash;whose goodness first touched his childish heart, and taught
      him that blows and taunts and degradation were not to be his only portion
      in the world.2

        1 The author has many times heard him make the application. While he
        seldom, if ever, spoke of his own mother, he loved to dwell on the
        beautiful character of Sally Bush. 2 The following description of her
        personal appearance is from the pen of her granddaughter, the daughter
        of Dennis Hanks:&mdash; "When I landed in Indiana," says Mrs. Lincoln,
        "Abe was about nine years old, and the country was wild and desolate. It
        is certain enough that her presence took away much that was desolate in
        his lot. She clothed him decently, and had him sent to school as soon as
        there was a school to send him to. But, notwithstanding her
        determination to do the best for him, his advantages in this respect
        were very limited. He had already had a few days', or perhaps a few
        weeks' experience, under the discipline of Riney and Hazel, in Kentucky;
        and, as he was naturally quick in the acquisition of any sort of
        knowledge, it is likely that by this time he could read and write a
        little. He was now to have the benefit of a few months more of public
        instruction; but the poverty of the family, and the necessity for his
        being made to work at home in the shop and on the farm, or abroad as a
        hired boy, made his attendance at school, for any great length of time,
        a thing impossible. Accordingly, all his school-days added together
        would not make a single year in the aggregate. "His wife, my
        grandmother, is a very tall woman; straight as an Indian, fair
        complexion, and was, when I first remember her, very handsome,
        sprightly, talkative, and proud; wore her hair curled till gray; is
        kind-hearted and very charitable, and also very industrious."&mdash;Mrs.

      Abraham began his irregular attendance at the nearest school very soon
      after he fell under the care of the second Mrs. Lincoln. It was probably
      in the winter of 1819, she having come out in the December of that year.
      It has been seen that she was as much impressed by his mental precocity as
      by the good qualities of his heart.

      Hazel Dorsey was his first master.1 He presided in a small house near the
      Little Pigeon Creek meeting-house, a mile and a half from the Lincoln
      cabin. It was built of unhewn logs, and had "holes for windows," in which
      "greased paper" served for glass. The roof was just high enough for a man
      to stand erect. Here he was taught reading, writing, and ciphering. They
      spelled in classes, and "trapped" up and down. These juvenile contests
      were very exciting to the participants; and it is said by the survivors,
      that Abe was even then the equal, if not the superior, of any scholar in
      his class.

      The next teacher was Andrew Crawford. Mrs. Gentry says he began pedagogue
      in the neighborhood in the winter of 1822-3, whilst most of his other
      scholars are unable to fix an exact date. He "kept" in the same little
      schoolhouse which had been the scene of Dorsey's labors, and the windows
      were still adorned with the greased leaves of old copybooks that had come
      down from Dorsey's time. Abe was now in his fifteenth year, and began to
      exhibit symptoms of gallantry toward the weaker sex, as we shall presently
      discover. He was growing at a tremendous rate, and two years later
      attained his full height of six feet four inches. He was long, wiry, and
      strong; while his big feet and hands, and the length of his legs and arms,
      were out of all proportion to his small trunk and head. His complexion was
      very swarthy, and Mrs. Gentry says that his skin was shrivelled and yellow
      even then. He wore low shoes, buckskin breeches, linsey-woolsey shirt, and
      a cap made of the skin of an opossum or a coon. The breeches clung close
      to his thighs and legs, but failed by a large space to meet the tops of
      his shoes. Twelve inches remained uncovered, and exposed that much of
      "shinbone, sharp, blue, and narrow."1 "He would always come to school
      thus, good-humoredly and laughing," says his old friend, Nat Grigsby. "He
      was always in good health, never was sick, had an excellent constitution,
      and took care of it."

      Crawford taught "manners." This was a feature of backwoods education to
      which Dorsey had not aspired, and Crawford had doubtless introduced it as
      a refinement which would put to shame the humbler efforts of his
      predecessor. One of the scholars was required to retire, and re-enter as a
      polite gentleman is supposed to enter a drawing-room. He was received at
      the door by another scholar, and conducted from bench to bench, until he
      had been introduced to all the "young ladies and gentlemen" in the room.
      Abe went through the ordeal countless times. If he took a serious view of
      the business, it must have put him to exquisite torture; for he was
      conscious that he was not a perfect type of manly beauty, with his long
      legs and blue shins, his small head, his great ears, and shrivelled skin.
      If, however, it struck him as at all funny, it must have filled him with
      unspeakable mirth, and given rise to many antic tricks and sly jokes, as
      he was gravely led about, shamefaced and gawky, under the very eye of the
      precise Crawford, to be introduced to the boys and girls of his most
      ancient acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though Crawford inculcated manners, he by no means neglected
      spelling. Abe was a good speller, and liked to use his knowledge, not only
      to secure honors for himself, but to help his less fortunate schoolmates
      out of their troubles, and he was exceedingly ingenious in the selection
      of expedients for conveying prohibited hints. One day Crawford gave out
      the difficult word <i>defied</i>. A large class was on the floor, but they
      all provokingly failed to spell it. D-e-f-i-d-e, said one; d-e-f-y-d-e,
      said another; d-e-f-y-d,&mdash;d-e-f-y-e-d, cried another and another. But
      it was all wrong: it was shameful, that, among all these big boys and
      girls, nobody could spell "<i>defied</i>;" Crawford's wrath gathered in
      clouds over his terrible brow. He made the helpless culprits shake with
      fear. He declared he would keep the whole class in all day and all night,
      if "<i>defied</i>" was not spelled. There was among them a Miss Roby, a
      girl fifteen years of age, whom we must suppose to have been pretty, for
      Abe was evidently half in love with her. "I saw Lincoln at the window,"
      says she: "he had his finger in his <i>eye</i>, and a smile on his face; I
      instantly took the hint, that I must change the letter <i>y</i> into an <i>i</i>.
      Hence I spelled the word,&mdash;the class let out. I felt grateful to
      Lincoln for this simple thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat Grigsby tells us, with unnecessary particularity, that "essays and
      poetry were not taught in this school." "Abe took it (them) up on his own
      account." He first wrote short sentences against "cruelty to animals," and
      at last came forward with a regular "composition" on the subject. He was
      very much annoyed and pained by the conduct of the boys, who were in the
      habit of catching terrapins, and putting coals of fire on their backs. "He
      would chide us," says Nat, "tell us it was wrong, and would write against
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The third and last school to which Abe went was taught by a Mr. Swaney, in
      1826. To get there, he had to travel four and a half miles; and this going
      back and forth so great a distance occupied entirely too much of his time.
      His attendance was therefore only at odd times, and was speedily broken
      off altogether. The schoolhouse was much like the other one near the
      Pigeon Creek meeting-house, except that it had two chimneys instead of
      one. The course of instruction was precisely the same as under Dorsey and
      Crawford, save that Swaney, like Dorsey, omitted the great department of
      "manners." "Here," says John Hoskins, the son of the settler who had
      "blazed out" the trail for Tom Lincoln, "we would choose up, and spell as
      in old times every Friday night." Hoskins himself tore down "the old
      schoolhouse" long since, and built a stable with the logs. He is now half
      sorry for his haste, and reverently presented Mr. Herndon a piece of the
      wood as a precious memento of his old friend Abe. An oak-tree, blackened
      and killed by the smoke that issued from the two chimneys, spreads its
      naked arms over the spot where the schoolhouse stood. Among its roots is a
      fine, large spring, over whose limpid waters Abe often bent to drink, and
      laughed at the reflection of his own homely face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe never went to school again in Indiana or elsewhere. Mr. Turnham tells
      us, that he had excelled all his masters, and it was "no use" for him to
      attempt to learn any thing from them. But he continued his studies at
      home, or wherever he was hired out to work, with a perseverance which
      showed that he could scarcely live without some species of mental
      excitement. He was by no means fond of the hard manual labor to which his
      own necessities and those of his family compelled him. Many of his
      acquaintances state this fact with strong emphasis,&mdash;among them
      Dennis Hanks and Mrs. Lincoln. His neighbor, John Romine, declares that
      Abe was "awful lazy. He worked for me; was always reading and thinking;
      used to get mad at him. He worked for me in 1829, pulling fodder. I say
      Abe was awful lazy: he would laugh and talk and crack jokes and tell
      stories all the time; didn't love work, but did dearly love his pay. He
      worked for me frequently, a few days only at a time.... Lincoln said to me
      one day, that his father taught him to work, but never learned him to love
      it."

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 Whenever Mrs. Sarah Lincoln speaks, we follow her implicitly.
        Regarding Abe's habits and conduct at home, her statement is a very full
        one. It is, however, confirmed and supplemented by all the other members
        of the family who were alive in 1866.

      Abe loved to lie under a shade-tree, or up in the loft of the cabin, and
      read, cipher, and scribble. At night he sat by the chimney "jamb," and
      ciphered, by the light of the fire, on the wooden fire-shovel. When the
      shovel was fairly covered, he would shave it off with Tom Lincoln's
      drawing-knife, and begin again. In the daytime he used boards for the same
      purpose, out of doors, and went through the shaving process everlastingly.
      His step-mother1 repeats often, that "he read every book he could lay his
      hand on." She says, "Abe read diligently.... He read every book he could
      lay his hands on; and, when he came across a passage that struck him, he
      would write it down on boards if he had no paper, and keep it there until
      he did get paper. Then he would re-write it, look at it, repeat it. He had
      a copy-book, a kind of scrapbook, in which he put down all things, and
      thus preserved them."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Hanks came out from Kentucky when Abe was fourteen years of age, and
      lived four years with the Lincolns. We cannot describe some of Abe's
      habits better than John has described them for us: "When Lincoln&mdash;Abe
      and I&mdash;returned to the house from work, he would go to the cupboard,
      snatch a piece of corn-bread, take down a book, sit down on a chair, cock
      his legs up high as his head, and read. He and I worked barefooted,
      grubbed it, ploughed, mowed, and cradled together; ploughed corn, gathered
      it, and shucked corn. Abraham read constantly when he had an opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the books upon which Abe "laid his hands" were "Æsop's Fables,"
      "Robinson Crusoe," Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," a "History of the United
      States," and Weems's "Life of Washington." All these he read many times,
      and transferred extracts from them to the boards and the scrapbook. He had
      procured the scrap-book because most of his literature was borrowed, and
      he thought it profitable to take copious notes from the books before he
      returned them. David Turnham had bought a volume of "The Revised Statutes
      of Indiana;" but, as he was "acting constable" at the time, he could not
      lend it to Abe. But Abe was not to be baffled in his purpose of going
      through and through every book in the neighborhood; and so, says Mr.
      Turnham, "he used to come to my house and sit and read it." 1 Dennis Hanks
      would fain have us believe that he himself was the purchaser of this book,
      and that he had stood as a sort of first preceptor to Abe in the science
      of law. "I had like to forgot," writes Dennis, with his usual modesty,
      "How did Abe get his knowledge of law? This is the fact about it. I bought
      the 'Statute of Indiana,' and from that he learned the principles of law,
      and also myself. Every man should become acquainted of the principles of
      law." The Bible, according to Mrs. Lincoln, was not one of his studies:
      "he sought more congenial books." At that time he neither talked nor read
      upon religious subjects. If he had any opinions about them, he kept them
      to himself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        1 He also read at Turnham's house Scott's Lessons and Sindbad the
        Sailor.

    <p>
      Abraham borrowed Weems's "Life of Washington" from his neighbor, old
      Josiah Crawford,&mdash;not Andrew Crawford, the school-teacher, as some of
      his biographers have it. The "Life" was read with great avidity in the
      intervals of work, and, when not in use, was carefully deposited on a
      shelf, made of a clapboard laid on two pins. But just behind the shelf
      there was a great crack between the logs of the wall; and one night, while
      Abe was dreaming in the loft, a storm came up, and the rain, blown through
      the opening, soaked his precious book from cover to cover. Crawford was a
      sour and churlish fellow at best, and flatly refused to take the damaged
      book back again. He said, that, if Abe had no money to pay for it, he
      could work it out. Of course, there was no alternative; and Abe was
      obliged to discharge the debt by "pulling fodder" three days, at
      twenty-five cents a day. Crawford afterwards paid dearly for his
      churlishness.

      At home, with his step-mother and the children, he was the most agreeable
      fellow in the world. "He was always ready to do every thing for
      everybody." When he was not doing some special act of kindness, he told
      stories or "cracked jokes." "He was as full of his yarns in Indiana as
      ever he was in Illinois." Dennis Hanks was a clever hand at the same
      business, and so was old Tom Lincoln. Among them they must have made
      things very lively, during the long winter evenings, for John Johnston and
      the good old lady and the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lincoln was never able to speak of Abe's conduct to her without
      tears. In her interview with Mr. Herndon, when the sands of her life had
      nearly run out, she spoke with deep emotion of her own son, but said she
      thought that Abe was kinder, better, truer, than the other. Even the
      mother's instinct was lost as she looked back over those long years of
      poverty and privation in the Indiana cabin, when Abe's grateful love
      softened the rigors of her lot, and his great heart and giant frame were
      always at her command. "Abe was a poor boy," said she; "and I can say what
      scarcely one woman&mdash;a mother&mdash;can say in a thousand. Abe never
      gave me a cross word or look, and never refused, in fact or appearance, to
      do any thing I requested him. I never gave him a cross word in all my
      life.... His mind and mine&mdash;what little I had&mdash;seemed to run
      together.... He was here after he was elected President." (At this point
      the aged speaker turned away to weep, and then, wiping her eyes with her
      apron, went on with the story). "He was dutiful to me always. I think he
      loved me truly. I had a son, John, who was raised with Abe. Both were good
      boys; but I must say, both now being dead, that Abe was the best boy I
      ever saw, or expect to see. I wish I had died when my husband died. I did
      not want Abe to run for President; did not want him elected; was afraid
      somehow,&mdash;felt in my heart; and when he came down to see me, after he
      was elected President, I still felt that something told me that something
      would befall Abe, and that I should see him no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any thing in the language we speak more touching than that simple
      plaint of the woman whom we must regard as Abraham Lincoln's mother? The
      apprehension in her "heart" was well grounded. She "saw him no more." When
      Mr. Herndon rose to depart, her eyes again filled with tears; and,
      wringing his hands as if loath to part with one who talked so much of her
      beloved Abe, she said, "Good-by, my good son's friend. Farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe had a very retentive memory. He frequently amused his young companions
      by repeating to them long passages from the books he had been reading. On
      Monday mornings he would mount a stump, and deliver, with a wonderful
      approach to exactness, the sermon he had heard the day before. His taste
      for public speaking appeared to be natural and irresistible. His
      step-sister, Matilda Johnston, says he was an indefatigable "preacher."
      "When father and mother would go to church, Abe would take down the Bible,
      read a verse, give out a hymn, and we would sing. Abe was about fifteen
      years of age. He preached, and we would do the crying. Sometimes he would
      join in the chorus of tears. One day my brother, John Johnston, caught a
      land terrapin, brought it to the place where Abe was preaching, threw it
      against the tree, and crushed the shell. It suffered much,&mdash;quivered
      all over. Abe then preached against cruelty to animals, contending that an
      ant's life was as sweet to it as ours to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this practice of "preaching" and political speaking, into which Abe
      had fallen, at length became a great nuisance to old, Tom. It distracted
      everybody, and sadly interfered with the work. If Abe had confined his
      discourses to Sunday preaching, while the old folks were away, it would
      not have been so objectionable. But he knew his power, liked to please
      everybody, and would be sure to set up as an orator wherever he found the
      greatest number of people together. When it was announced that Abe had
      taken the "stump" in the harvest-field, there was an end of work. The
      hands flocked around him, and listened to his curious speeches with
      infinite delight. "The sight of such a thing amused all," says Mrs.
      Lincoln; though she admits that her husband was compelled to break it up
      with the strong hand; and poor Abe was many times dragged from the
      platform, and hustled off to his work in no gentle manner.1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 We are told by Col. Chapman that Abe's father habitually treated him
        with great barbarity. Dennis Hanks insists that he loved him sincerely,
        but admits that he now and then knocked him from the fence for merely
        answering traveller's questions about the roads.

    <p>
      Abe worked occasionally with Tom Lincoln in the shop; but he did it
      reluctantly, and never intended to learn even so much of the trade as
      Lincoln was able to teach him. The rough work turned out at that shop was
      far beneath his ambition, and he had made up his mind to lead a life as
      wholly unlike his father's as he could possibly make it. He therefore
      refused to be a carpenter. But he could not afford to be idle; and, as
      soon as he was able to earn wages, he was hired out among the neighbors.
      He worked for many of them a few months at a time, and seemed perfectly
      willing to transfer his services wherever they were wanted, so that his
      father had no excuse for persecuting him with entreaties about learning to
      make tables and cupboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe was now becoming a man, and was, in fact, already taller than any man
      in the neighborhood. He was a universal favorite, and his wit and humor
      made him heartily welcome at every cabin between the two Pigeon Creeks.
      Any family was glad when "Abe Linkern" was hired to work with them; for he
      did his work well, and made them all merry while he was about it. The
      women were especially pleased, for Abe was not above doing any kind of
      "chores" for them. He was always ready to make a fire, carry water, or
      nurse a baby. But what manner of people were these amongst whom he passed
      the most critical part of his life? We must know them if we desire to know
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lived in the neighborhood of Gentryville a Mrs. Elizabeth Crawford,
      wife to the now celebrated Josiah with the sour temper and the blue nose.
      Abe was very fond of her, and inclined to "let himself out" in her
      company. She fortunately possessed a rare memory, and Mr. Herndon's rich
      collection of manuscripts was made richer still by her contributions. We
      have from her a great mass of valuable, and sometimes extremely amusing,
      information. Among it is the following graphic, although rude, account of
      the Pigeon Creek people in general:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to tell you how the people used to go to meeting,&mdash;how
      far they went. At that time we thought it nothing to go eight or ten
      miles. The old ladies did not stop for the want of a shawl, or cloak, or
      riding-dress, or two horses, in the winter-time; but they would put on
      their husbands' old overcoats, and wrap up their little ones, and take one
      or two of them up on their beasts, and their husbands would walk, and they
      would go to church, and stay in the neighborhood until the next day, and
      then go home. The old men would start out of their fields from their work,
      or out of the woods from hunting, with their guns on their shoulders, and
      go to church. Some of them dressed in deer-skin pants and moccasins,
      hunting-shirts with a rope or leather strap around them. They would come
      in laughing, shake hands all around, sit down and talk about their game
      they had killed, or some other work they had done, and smoke their pipes
      together with the old ladies. If in warm weather, they would kindle up a
      little fire out in the meeting-house yard, to light their pipes. If in
      winter-time, they would hold church in some of the neighbors' houses. At
      such times they were always treated with the utmost of kindness: a bottle
      of whiskey, a pitcher of water, sugar and glass, were set out, or a basket
      of apples, or turnips, or some pies and cakes. Apples were scarce them
      times. Sometimes potatoes were used as a treat. (I must tell you that the
      first treat I ever received in old Mr. Linkern's house, that was our
      President's father's house, was a plate of potatoes, washed and pared very
      nicely, and handed round. It was something new to me, for I never had seen
      a raw potato eaten before. I looked to see how they made use of them. They
      took off a potato, and ate them like apples.) Thus they spent the time
      till time for preaching to commence, then they would all take their seats:
      the preacher would take his stand, draw his coat, open his shirt-collar,
      commence service by singing and prayer; take his text and preach till the
      sweat would roll off in great drops. Shaking hands and singing then ended
      the service. The people seemed to enjoy religion more in them days than
      they do now. They were glad to see each other, and enjoyed themselves
      better than they do now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Society about Gentryville was little different from that of any other
      backwoods settlement of the same day. The houses were scattered far apart;
      but the inhabitants would travel long distances to a log-rolling, a
      house-raising, a wedding, or any thing else that might be turned into a
      fast and furious frolic. On such occasions the young women carried their
      shoes in their hands, and only put them on when about to join the company.
      The ladies drank whiskey-toddy, while the men took it straight; and both
      sexes danced the live-long night, barefooted, on puncheon floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair sex wore "cornfield bonnets, scoop-shaped, flaring in front, and
      long though narrow behind." Shoes were the mode when entering the
      ball-room; but it was not at all fashionable to scuff them out by walking
      or dancing in them. "Four yards of linsey-woolsey, a yard in width, made a
      dress for any woman." The waist was short, and terminated just under the
      arms, whilst the skirt was long and narrow. "Crimps and puckering frills"
      it had none. The coats of the men were home-made; the materials, jeans or
      linsey-woolsey. The waists were short, like the frocks of the women, and
      the long "claw-hammer" tail was split up to the waist. This, however, was
      company dress, and the hunting-shirt did duty for every day. The breeches
      were of buck-skin or jeans; the cap was of coon-skin; and the shoes of
      leather tanned at home. If no member of the family could make shoes, the
      leather was taken to some one who could, and the customer paid the maker a
      fair price in some other sort of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of agriculture was what it always is where there is no market,
      either to sell or buy; where the implements are few and primitive, and
      where there are no regular mechanics. The Pigeon Creek farmer "tickled"
      two acres of ground in a day with his old shovel-plough, and got but half
      a crop. He cut one acre with his sickle, while the modern machine lays
      down in neat rows ten. With his flail and horse tramping, he threshed out
      fifteen bushels of wheat; while the machine of to-day, with a few more
      hands, would turn out three hundred and fifty. He "fanned" and "cleaned
      with a sheet." When he wanted flour, he took his team and went to a
      "horse-mill," where he spent a whole day in converting fifteen bushels of
      grain.1

        mostly; some wheat,&mdash;enough for a cake on Sunday morning. Hogs and
        venison hams were legal tender, and coon-skins also. We raised sheep and
        cattle, but they did not fetch much. Cows and calves were only worth six
        dollars; corn, ten cents; wheat, twenty-five cents at that time."&mdash;

      The minds of these people were filled with superstitions, which most
      persons imagine to be, at least, as antiquated as witch-burning. They
      firmly believed in witches and all kind of witch-doings. They sent for
      wizards to cure sick cattle. They shot the image of the witch with a
      silver ball, to break the spell she was supposed to have laid on a human
      being. If a dog ran directly across a man's path whilst he was hunting, it
      was terrible "luck," unless he instantly hooked his two little fingers
      together, and pulled with all his might, until the dog was out of sight.
      There were wizards who took charmed twigs in their hands, and made them
      point to springs of water and all kinds of treasure beneath the earth's
      surface. There were "faith doctors," who cured diseases by performing
      mysterious ceremonies and muttering cabalistic words. If a bird alighted
      in a window, one of the family would speedily die. If a horse breathed on
      a child, the child would have the whooping-cough. Every thing must be done
      at certain "times and seasons," else it would be attended with "bad luck."
      They must cut trees for rails in the early part of the day, and in "the
      light of the moon." They must make fence in "the light of the moon;"
      otherwise, the fence would sink. Potatoes and other roots were to be
      planted in the "dark of the moon," but trees, and plants which bore their
      fruits above ground, must be "put out in the light of the moon." The moon
      exerted a fearful influence, either kindly or malignant, as the good old
      rules were observed or not. It was even required to make soap "in the
      light of the moon," and, moreover, it must be stirred only one way, and by
      one person. Nothing of importance was to be begun on Friday. All
      enterprises inaugurated on that day went fatally amiss. A horse-colt could
      be begotten only "in the dark of the moon," and animals treated otherwise
      than "according to the signs in the almanac" were nearly sure to die.

      Such were the people among whom Abe grew to manhood. With their sons and
      daughters he went to school. Upon their farms he earned his daily bread by
      daily toil. From their conversation he formed his earliest opinions of men
      and things, the world over. Many of their peculiarities became his; and
      many of their thoughts and feelings concerning a multitude of subjects
      were assimilated with his own, and helped to create that unique character,
      which, in the eyes of a great host of the American people, was only less
      curious and amusing than it was noble and august.
    </p>
    <p>
      His most intimate companions were of course, for a long time, the members
      of his own family. The reader already knows something of Thomas Lincoln,
      and that pre-eminently good woman, Sally Bush. The latter, we know,
      washed, clothed, loved, and encouraged Abe in well-doing, from the moment
      he fell in her way. How much he owed to her goodness and affection, he was
      himself never able to estimate. That it was a great debt, fondly
      acknowledged and cheerfully repaid as far as in him lay, there can be no
      doubt. His own sister, the child of Nancy Hanks, was warmly attached to
      him. Her face somewhat resembled his. In repose it had the gravity which
      they both, perhaps, inherited from their mother; but it was capable of
      being lighted almost into beauty by one of Abe's ridiculous stories or
      rapturous sallies of humor. She was a modest, plain, industrious girl, and
      is kindly remembered by all who knew her. She was married to Aaron Grigsby
      at eighteen, and a year after died in child-bed. Like Abe, she
      occasionally worked out at the houses of the neighbors, and at one time
      was employed in Mrs. Crawford's kitchen, while her brother was a laborer
      on the same farm. She lies buried, not with her mother, but in the yard of
      the old Pigeon Creek meeting-house. It is especially pleasing to read the
      encomiums lavished upon her memory by the Grigsbys; for between the
      Grigsbys on one side, and Abe and his step-brother on the other, there
      once subsisted a fierce feud.

      As we have already learned from Dennis Hanks, the two families&mdash;the
      Johnstons and the Lincolns&mdash;"got along finely together." The
      affectionate relations between Abe and his two step-sisters were the
      subject of common remark throughout the neighborhood. One of them married
      Dennis Hanks, and the other Levi Hall, or, as he is better known, Squire
      Hall,&mdash;a cousin of Abe. Both these women (the latter now Mrs. Moore)
      furnished Mr. Herndon very valuable memoirs of Abe's life whilst he dwelt
      under the same roof with them; and they have given an account of him which
      shows that the ties between them were of the strongest and tenderest kind.
      But what is most remarkable in their statements is, that they never opened
      their lips without telling how worthy of everybody's love their mother
      was, and how Abe revered her as much as they did. They were interesting
      girls, and became exemplary women.
    </p>
    <p>
      John D. Johnston, the only son of Mrs. Lincoln, was not the best boy, and
      did not grow to be the best man, in all the Pigeon Creek region. He had no
      positive vice, except idleness, and no special virtue but good temper. He
      was not a fortunate man; never made money; was always needy, and always
      clamoring for the aid of his friends. Mr. Lincoln, all through John's
      life, had much trouble to keep him on his legs, and succeeded
      indifferently in all his attempts. In a subsequent chapter a letter will
      be given from him, which indirectly portrays his step-brother's character
      much better than it can be done here. But, as youths, the intimacy between
      them was very close; and in another place it will appear that Abe
      undertook his second voyage to New Orleans only on condition that John
      would go along.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most constant of his companions was his jolly cousin, Dennis
      Hanks. Of all the contributors to Mr. Herndon's store of information,
      good, bad, and indifferent, concerning this period of Mr. Lincoln's life,
      Dennis is the most amusing, insinuating, and prolific. He would have it
      distinctly understood that the well of his memory is the only proper
      source whence any thing like truth may be drawn.1 He has covered countless
      sheets of paper devoted to indiscriminate laudations of Abe and all his
      kindred. But in all this he does not neglect to say a word for himself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 The following random selections from his writings leave us no room to
        doubt Dennis's opinion of his own value:&mdash; "William, let in, don't
        keep any thing back, for I am in for the whole hog sure; for I know
        nobody can do any for you much, for all they know is from me at last.
        Every thing you see is from my notes,&mdash;this you can tell yourself.
        "I have in my possession a little book, the private life of A. Lincoln,
        comprising a full life of his early years, and a succinct record of his
        career as statesman and President, by O. J. Victor, author of Lives of
        Garibaldi, Winfield Scott, John Paul Jones, &amp;c., New York, Beadle
        and Company, publishers, No. 118 Williams Street. Now, sir, I find a
        great many things pertaining to Abe Lincoln's life that is not true. If
        you would like to have the book, I will mail it to you. I will say this
        much to you: if you don't have my name very frequently in your book, it
        won't go at all; for I have been East for two months, have seen a great
        many persons in that time, stating to them that there would be a book,
        'The Life of A. Lincoln,' published, giving a full account of the
        family, from England to this country. Now, William, if there be any
        thing you want to know, let me know: I will give you all the information
        I can. "I have seen a letter that you wrote to my daughter, Harriet
        Chapman, of inquiry about some things. I thought you were informed all
        about them. I don't know what she has stated to you about your
        questions; but you had better consult me about them. "Billy, it seems to
        me, from the letters that you write to me asking questions, that you ask
        the same questions over several times. How is this? Do you forget, or
        are you like the lawyer, trying to make me cross my path, or not? Now, I
        will. Look below for the answer."

      At one place, "his cousin, Dennis Hanks," is said to have taught Abe to
      read and write. At another, he is represented as the benevolent purchaser
      of the volumes from which Abe (and Dennis too) derived a wonderfully clear
      and accurate conception of the science of law. In all studies their minds
      advanced <i>pari passu</i>. Whenever any differences are noted (and they
      are few and slight), Dennis is a step ahead, benignantly extending a
      helping hand to the lagging pupil behind. But Dennis's heart is big and
      kind: he defames no one; he is merely a harmless romancer. In the gallery
      of family portraits painted by Dennis, every face looks down upon us with
      the serenity of innocence and virtue. There is no spot on the fame of any
      one of them. No family could have a more vigorous or chivalrous defender
      than he, or one who repelled with greater scorn any rumor to their
      discredit. That Enlow story! Dennis almost scorned to confute it; but,
      when he did get at it, he settled it by a magnificent exercise of
      inventive genius. He knew "this Abe Enlow" well, he said, and he had been
      dead precisely fifty-five years. But, whenever the truth can be told
      without damage to the character of a Lincoln or a Hanks, Dennis will tell
      it candidly enough, provided there is no temptation to magnify himself.
      His testimony, however, has been sparingly used throughout these pages;
      and no statement has been taken from him unless it was more or less
      directly corroborated by some one else. The better part of his evidence
      Mr. Herndon took the precaution of reading carefully to John Hanks, who
      pronounced it substantially true; and that circumstance gives it
      undeniable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thomas and Betsy Sparrow died in the fall of 1818, Dennis was taken
      from the "little half-faced camp," and became one of the Lincoln family.
      Until Thomas Lincoln's second marriage, Dennis, Abe, and Sarah were all
      three poor, ragged, and miserable together. After that, Dennis got along
      better, as well as the rest. He was a lively, volatile, sympathetic
      fellow, and Abe liked him well from the beginning. They fished, hunted,
      and worked in company; loafed at the grocery, where Dennis got drunk, and
      Abe told stories; talked politics with Col. Jones; "swapped jokes" with
      Baldwin the blacksmith; and faithfully attended the sittings of the
      nearest justice of the peace, where both had opportunities to correct and
      annotate the law they thought they had learned from the "Statute of
      Indiana." Dennis was kind, genial, lazy, brimming over with humor, and
      full of amusing anecdotes. He revelled in song, from the vulgarest ballad
      to the loftiest hymn of devotion; from "The turbaned Turk, that scorns the
      world," to the holiest lines of Doctor Watts. These qualities marked him
      wherever he went; and in excessive good-nature, and in the ease with which
      he passed from the extreme of rigor to the extreme of laxity, he was
      distinguished above the others of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one Hanks, however, who was not like Dennis, or any other Hanks
      we know any thing about: this was "old John," as he is familiarly called
      in Illinois,&mdash;a sober, honest, truthful man, with none of the wit and
      none of the questionable accomplishments of Dennis. He was the son of
      Joseph, the carpenter with whom Tom Lincoln learned the trade. He went to
      Indiana to live with the Lincolns when Abe was fourteen years of age, and
      remained there four years. He then returned to Kentucky, and subsequently
      went to Illinois, where he was speedily joined by the old friends he had
      left in Indiana. When Abe separated from the family, and went in search of
      individual fortune, it was in company with "old John." Together they split
      the rails that did so much to make Abe President; and "old John" set the
      ball in motion by carrying a part of them into the Decatur Convention on
      his own broad shoulders. John had no education whatever, except that of
      the muscles and the heart. He could neither read nor write; but his
      character was pure and respectable, and Lincoln esteemed him as a man, and
      loved him as a friend and relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six years after the death of the first Mrs. Lincoln, Levi Hall and
      his wife and family came to Indiana, and settled near the Lincolns. Mrs.
      Hall was Nancy Hanks, the mother of our friend Dennis, and the aunt of
      Nancy Hanks, the mother of Abraham Lincoln. She had numerous children by
      her husband. One of them, Levi, as already mentioned, married one of Abe's
      step-sisters, while Dennis, his half-brother, married the other one. The
      father and mother of the Halls speedily died of the milk-sickness, but
      Levi was for many years a constant companion of Abe and Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1825 Abraham was employed by James Taylor, who lived at the mouth of
      Anderson's Creek. He was paid six dollars a month, and remained for nine
      months. His principal business was the management of a ferry-boat which
      Mr. Taylor had plying across the Ohio, as well as Anderson's Creek. But,
      in addition to this, he was required to do all sorts of farm-work, and
      even to perform some menial services about the house. He was hostler,
      ploughman, ferryman, out of doors, and man-of-all-work within doors. He
      ground corn with a hand-mill, or "grated" it when too young to be ground;
      rose early, built fires, put on the water in the kitchen, "fixed around
      generally," and had things prepared for cooking before the mistress of the
      house was stirring. He slept up stairs with young Green Taylor, who says
      that he usually read "till near midnight," notwithstanding the necessity
      for being out of his bed before day. Green was somewhat disposed to
      ill-use the poor hired boy, and once struck him with an ear of hard corn,
      and cut a deep gash over his eye. He makes no comment upon this generous
      act, except that "Abe got mad," but did not thrash him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe was a hand much in demand in "hog-killing time." He butchered not only
      for Mr. Taylor, but for John Woods, John Duthan, Stephen McDaniels, and
      others. At this he earned thirty-one cents a day, as it was considered
      "rough work."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time there was only one person in the neighborhood for whom Abe
      felt a decided dislike; and that was Josiah Crawford, who had made him
      "pull fodder," to pay for the Weems's "Washington." On that score he was
      "hurt" and "mad," and often declared "he would have revenge." But being a
      poor boy,&mdash;a circumstance of which Crawford had already taken
      shameful advantage to extort three days' labor,&mdash;he was glad to get
      work any place, and frequently "hired to his old adversary." Abe's first
      business in his employ was daubing his cabin, which was built of logs,
      unhewed, and with the bark on. In the loft of this house, thus finished by
      his own hands, he slept for many weeks at a time. He spent his evenings as
      he did at home,&mdash;writing on wooden shovels or boards with "a coal, or
      keel, from the branch." This family was rich in the possession of several
      books, which Abe read through time and again, according to his usual
      custom. One of them was the "Kentucky Preceptor," from which Mrs. Crawford
      insists that he "learned his school orations, speeches, and pieces to
      write." She tells us also that "Abe was a sensitive lad, never coming
      where he was not wanted;" that he always lifted his hat, and bowed, when
      he made his appearance; and that "he was tender and kind," like his
      sister, who was at the same time her maid-of-all-work. His pay was
      twenty-five cents a day; "and, when he missed time, he would not charge
      for it." This latter remark of good Mrs. Crawford reveals the fact that
      her husband was in the habit of docking Abe on his miserable wages
      whenever he happened to lose a few minutes from steady work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came, however, when Abe got his "revenge" for all this petty
      brutality. Crawford was as ugly as he was surly. His nose was a
      monstrosity,&mdash;long and crooked, with a huge, misshapen "stub" at the
      end, surmounted by a host of pimples, and the whole as "blue" as the usual
      state of Mr. Crawford's spirits. Upon this member Abe levelled his attack
      in rhyme, song, and "chronicle;" and, though he could not reduce the nose,
      he gave it a fame as wide as to the Wabash and the Ohio. It is not
      improbable that he learned the art of making the doggerel rhymes in which
      he celebrated Crawford's nose from the study of Crawford's own "Kentucky
      Preceptor." At all events, his sallies upon this single topic achieved him
      great reputation as a "poet" and a wit, and caused Crawford intolerable
      anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is likely that Abe was reconciled to his situation in this family by
      the presence of his sister, and the opportunity it gave him of being in
      the company of Mrs. Crawford, for whom he had a genuine attachment; for
      she was nothing that her husband was, and every thing that he was not.
      According to her account, he split rails, ploughed, threshed, and did
      whatever else he was ordered to do; but she distinctly affirms that "Abe
      was no hand to pitch into his work like killing snakes." He went about it
      "calmly," and generally took the opportunity to throw "Crawford" down two
      or three times "before they went to the field." It is fair to presume,
      that, when Abe managed to inveigle his disagreeable employer into a
      tussle, he hoisted him high and threw him hard, for he felt that he had no
      reason to be careful of his bones. After meals Abe "hung about," lingered
      long to gossip and joke with the women; and these pleasant, stolen
      conferences were generally broken up with the exclamation, "Well, this
      won't buy the child a coat!" and the long-legged hired boy would stride
      away to join his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Abe had become, not only the longest, but the strongest,
      man in the settlement. Some of his feats almost surpass belief, and those
      who beheld them with their own eyes stood literally amazed. Richardson, a
      neighbor, declares that he could carry a load to which the strength of
      "three ordinary men" would scarcely be equal. He saw him quietly pick up
      and walk away with "a chicken-house, made of poles pinned together, and
      covered, that weighed at least six hundred, if not much more." At another
      time the Richardsons were building a corn-crib: Abe was there; and, seeing
      three or four men preparing "sticks" upon which to carry some huge posts,
      he relieved them of all further trouble by shouldering the posts,
      single-handed, and walking away with them to the place where they were
      wanted. "He could strike with a mall," says old Mr. Wood, "a heavier blow
      than any man.... He could sink an axe deeper into wood than any man I ever
      saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      For hunting purposes, the Pigeon Creek region was one of the most inviting
      on earth. The uplands were all covered with an original growth of majestic
      forest trees,1 whilst on the hillsides, and wherever an opening in the
      woods permitted the access of sunlight, there were beds of fragrant and
      beautiful wild-flowers, presenting, in contrast with the dense green
      around them, the most brilliant and agreeable effects. Here the game had
      vast and secluded ranges, which, until very recently, had heard the report
      of no white man's gun. In Abe's time, the squirrels, rabbits, partridges,
      and other varieties of smaller game, were so abundant as to be a nuisance.
      They devastated grain-fields and gardens; and while they were seldom shot
      for the table, the settlers frequently devised the most cunning means of
      destroying them in great quantities, in order to save the growing crops.
      Wild turkeys and deer were the principal reliance for food; but besides
      these were the bears, the wild-cats, and the panthers.1 The scream of the
      latter, the most ferocious and bloodthirsty of the cat kind, hastened
      Abe's homeward steps on many a dark night, as he came late from Dave
      Turnham's, "Uncle" Wood's, or the Gentryville grocery. That terrific cry
      appeals not only to the natural fear of the monster's teeth and claws,
      but, heard in the solitude of night and the forest, it awakens a feeling
      of superstitious horror, that chills the heart of the bravest.

      Everybody about Abe made hunting a part of his business.2 Tom Lincoln and
      Dennis Hanks doubtless regaled him continually with wonderful stories of
      their luck and prowess; but he was no hunter himself, and did not care to
      learn. It is true, that, when a mere child, he made a fortunate shot at a
      flock of wild turkeys, through a crack in the wall of the "half-faced
      cabin;"3 and that, when grown up, he went for coons occasionally with
      Richardson, or watched deer-licks with Turnham; but a true and hearty
      sportsman he never was. As practised on this wild border, it was a
      solitary, unsociable way of spending time, which did not suit his nature;
      and, besides, it required more exertion than he was willing to make
      without due compensation. It could not be said that Abe was indolent; for
      he was alert, brisk, active, about every thing that he made up his mind to
      do. His step was very quick; and, when he had a sufficient object in view,
      he strode out on his long, muscular legs, swinging his bony arms as he
      moved along, with an energy that put miles behind him before a lazy fellow
      like Dennis Hanks or John Johnston could make up his mind to start. But,
      when he felt that he had time to spare, he preferred to give it to reading
      or to "talk;" and, of the two, he would take the latter, provided he could
      find a person who had something new or racy to say. He liked excessively
      to hear his own voice, when it was promoting fun and good fellowship; but
      he was also a most rare and attentive listener. Hunting was entirely too
      "still" an occupation for him.

        suppose you mean take us all together. One thing I can tell you about:
        we had to work very hard cleaning ground for to keep body and soul
        together; and every spare time we had we picked up our rifle, and
        brought in a fine deer or turkey; and in the winter-time we went a
        coon-hunting, for coon-skins were at that time considered legal tender,
        and deer-skins' and hams. I tell you, Billy, I enjoyed myself better
        then than I ever have since."&mdash;Dennis Hanks. 3 "No doubt about the
        A. Lincoln's killing the turkey. He done it with his father's rifle,

      All manner of rustic sports were in vogue among the Pigeon Creek boys. Abe
      was especially formidable as a wrestler; and, from about 1828 onward,
      there was no man, far or near, that would give him a match. "Cat,"
      "throwing the mall," "hopping and half-hammon" (whatsoever that may mean),
      and "four-corner bull-pen" were likewise athletic games in high honor.1

        wrestling, we could throw down anybody."&mdash;Dennis Hanks.

    <p>
      All sorts of frolics and all kinds of popular gatherings, whether for work
      or amusement, possessed irresistible attractions for Abe. He loved to see
      and be seen, to make sport and to enjoy it. It was a most important part
      of his education that he got at the corn-shuckings, the log-rollings, the
      shooting-matches, and the gay and jolly weddings of those early border
      times. He was the only man or boy within a wide compass who had learning
      enough to furnish the literature for such occasions; and those who failed
      to employ his talents to grace or commemorate the festivities they set on
      foot were sure to be stung by some coarse but humorous lampoon from his
      pen. In the social way, he would not suffer himself to be slighted with
      impunity; and, if there were any who did not enjoy his wit, they might
      content themselves with being the subjects of it. Unless he received some
      very pointed intimation that his presence was not wanted, he was among the
      first and earliest at all the neighborhood routs; and when his tall,
      singular figure was seen towering amongst the hunting-shirts, it was
      considered due notice that the fun was about to commence. "Abe Linkhern,"
      as he was generally called, made things lively wherever he went: and, if
      Crawford's blue nose happened to have been carried to the assembly, it
      quickly subsided, on his arrival, into some obscure corner; for the
      implacable "Linkhern" was apt to make it the subject of a jest that would
      set the company in a roar. But when a party was made up, and Abe left out,
      as sometimes happened through the influence of Crawford, he sulked, fumed,
      "got mad," nursed his anger into rage, and then broke out in songs or
      "chronicles," which were frequently very bitter, sometimes passably
      humorous, and invariably vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an early age he began to attend the "preachings" roundabout, but
      principally at the Pigeon Creek church, with a view to catching whatever
      might be ludicrous in the preacher's air or matter, and making it the
      subject of mimicry as soon as he could collect an audience of idle boys
      and men to hear him. A pious stranger, passing that way on a Sunday
      morning, was invited to preach for the Pigeon Creek congregation; but he
      banged the boards of the old pulpit, and bellowed and groaned so
      wonderfully, that Abe could hardly contain his mirth. This memorable
      sermon was a great favorite with him; and he frequently reproduced it with
      nasal tones, rolling eyes, and all manner of droll aggravations, to the
      great delight of Nat Grigsby and the wild fellows whom Nat was able to
      assemble. None that heard him, not even Nat himself (who was any thing but
      dull), was ever able to show wherein Abe's absurd version really departed
      from the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of Gentryville, as a "centre of business," soon began to
      possess the imaginations of the dwellers between the two Pigeon Creeks.
      Why might it not be a great place of trade? Mr. Gentry was a most generous
      patron; it was advantageously situated where two roads crossed; it already
      had a blacksmith's shop, a grocery, and a store. Jones, it is true, had
      once moved away in a sulk, but Mr. Gentry's fine diplomacy had quickly
      brought him back, with all his goods and talents unreservedly devoted to
      the "improvement of the town;" and now, since there was literally nothing
      left to cloud the prospects of the "point," brisk times were expected in
      the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dennis Hanks, John Johnston, Abe, and the other boys in the neighborhood,
      loitered much about the store, the grocery, and the blacksmith's shop, at
      Gentryville. Dennis ingenuously remarks, "Sometimes we spent a little time
      at grog, pushing weights, wrestling, telling stories." The time that Abe
      "spent at grog" was, in truth, a "little time." He never liked ardent
      spirits at any period of his life; but "he did take his dram as others
      did."1 He was a natural politician, intensely ambitious, and anxious to be
      popular. For this reason, and this alone, he drank with his friends,
      although very temperately. If he could have avoided it without giving
      offence, he would gladly have done so. But he coveted the applause of his
      pot companions, and, because he could not get it otherwise, made a faint
      pretence of enjoying his liquor as they did. The "people" drank, and Abe
      was always for doing whatever the "people" did. All his life he held that
      whatsoever was popular&mdash;the habit or the sentiment of the masses&mdash;could
      not be essentially wrong. But, although a whiskey-jug was kept in every
      ordinarily respectable household, Abe never tasted it at home. His
      step-mother thought he carried his temperance to extremes.

      Jones, the great Jones, without whom it was generally agreed that
      Gentryville must have gone into eclipse, but with whom, and through whom,
      it was somehow to become a sort of metropolitan cross-roads,&mdash;Jones
      was Abe's friend and mentor from the moment of their acquaintance. Abe is
      even said to have "clerked for him;" that is, he packed and unpacked
      boxes, ranged goods on the shelves, drew the liquids in the cellar, or
      exhibited the stone and earthen ware to purchasers; but in his service he
      was never promoted to keeping accounts, or even to selling the finer goods
      across the counter.1 But Mr. Jones was very fond of his "clerk,"&mdash;enjoyed
      his company, appreciated his humor, and predicted something great for him.
      As he did not doubt that Abe would one day be a man of considerable
      influence, he took pains to give him correct views of the nature of
      American institutions. An ardent Jackson man himself, he imparted to Abe
      the true faith, as delivered by that great democratic apostle; and the
      traces of this teaching were never wholly effaced from Mr. Lincoln's mind.
      Whilst he remained at Gentryville, his politics accorded with Mr. Jones's;
      and, even after he had turned Whig in Illinois, John Hanks tells us that
      he wanted to whip a man for traducing Jackson. He was an eager reader of
      newspapers whenever he could get them, and Mr. Jones carefully put into
      his hands the kind he thought a raw youth should have. But Abe's appetite
      was not to be satisfied by what Mr. Jones supplied; and he frequently
      borrowed others from "Uncle Wood," who lived about a mile from the Lincoln
      cabin, and for whom he sometimes worked.

        great man one of these days,&mdash;had said so long before, and to other
        people,&mdash;said so as far back as 1828-9.'"&mdash;Dougherty.

      What manner of man kept the Gentryville grocery, we are not informed. Abe
      was often at his place, however, and would stay so long at nights,
      "telling stories" and "cracking jokes," that Dennis Hanks, who was
      ambitious in the same line, and probably jealous of Abe's overshadowing
      success, "got mad at him," and "cussed him." When Dennis found himself
      thrown in the shade, he immediately became virtuous, and wished to retire
      early.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baldwin, the blacksmith, was one of Abe's special friends from his
      boyhood onward. Baldwin was a story-teller and a joker of rare
      accomplishments; and Abe, when a very little fellow, would slip off to his
      shop and sit and listen to him by the hour. As he grew up, the practice
      continued as of old, except that Abe soon began to exchange anecdotes with
      his clever friend at the anvil. Dennis Hanks says Baldwin was his "<i>particular</i>
      friend," and that "Abe spent a great deal of his leisure time with him."
      Statesmen, plenipotentiaries, famous commanders, have many times made the
      White House at Washington ring with their laughter over the quaint tales
      of John Baldwin, the blacksmith, delivered second-hand by his inimitable
      friend Lincoln.

    <p>
      Abe and Dave Turnham had one day been threshing wheat,&mdash;probably for
      Turnham's father,&mdash;and concluded to spend the evening at Gentryville.
      They lingered there until late in the night, when, wending their way along
      the road toward Lincoln's cabin, they espied something resembling a man
      lying dead or insensible by the side of a mud-puddle. They rolled the
      sleeper over, and found in him an old and quite respectable acquaintance,
      hopelessly drunk. All efforts failed to rouse him to any exertion on his
      own behalf. Abe's companions were disposed to let him lie in the bed he
      had made for himself; but, as the night was cold and dreary, he must have
      frozen to death had this inhuman proposition been equally agreeable to
      everybody present. To Abe it seemed utterly monstrous; and, seeing he was
      to have no help, he bent his mighty frame, and, taking the big man in his
      long arms, carried him a great distance to Dennis Hanks's cabin. There he
      built a fire, warmed, rubbed, and nursed him through the entire night,&mdash;his
      companions of the road having left him alone in his merciful task. The man
      often told John Hanks, that it was mighty "clever in Abe to tote him to a
      warm fire that cold night," and was very sure that Abe's strength and
      benevolence had saved his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe was fond of music, but was himself wholly unable to produce three
      harmonious notes together. He made various vain attempts to sing a few
      lines of "Poor old Ned," but they were all equally ludicrous and
      ineffectual. "Religious songs did not appear to suit him at all," says
      Dennis Hanks; but of profane ballads and amorous ditties he knew the words
      of a vast number. When Dennis got happy at the grocery, or passed the
      bounds of propriety at a frolic, he was in the habit of raising a charming
      carol in praise of the joys which enter into the Mussulman's estate on
      earth,&mdash;of which he has vouchsafed us only three lines,&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The turbaned Turk that scorns the world, And struts about with his
        whiskers curled, For no other man but himself to see."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was a prime favorite of Abe's; and Dennis sang it with such appropriate
      zest and feeling, that Abe never forgot a single word of it while he
      lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Hail Columbia, happy land! If you ain't drunk, I'll be damned,"&mdash;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      a song which Dennis thinks should be warbled only in the "fields;" and
      tells us that they knew and enjoyed "all such [songs] as this." Dave
      Turnham was also a musical genius, and had a "piece" beginning,&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "There was a Romish lady Brought up in popery,"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      which Abe thought one of the best he ever heard, and insisted upon Dave's
      singing it for the delectation of old Tom Lincoln, who relished it quite
      as much as Abe did.1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 "I recollect some more:&mdash; 'Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
        Tune my heart to sing thy praise.' 'When I can read my title clear To
        mansions in the skies!' 'How tedious and tasteless the hours.' 'Oh! to
        grace how great a debtor!' Other little songs I won't say any thing
        about: they would not look well in print; but I could give them."&mdash;Dennis
        Hanks.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crawford says, that Abe did not attempt to sing much about the house:
      he was probably afraid to indulge in such offensive gayeties in the very
      habitation of the morose Crawford. According to Dennis Hanks, his melody
      was not of the sort that hath power to charm the savage; and he was
      naturally timid about trying it upon Crawford. But, when he was freed from
      those chilling restraints, he put forth his best endeavors to render "one
      [song] that was called 'William Riley,' and one that was called 'John
      Anderson's Lamentations,' and one that was made about Gen. Jackson and
      John Adams, at the time they were nominated for the presidency."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jackson song indicated clearly enough Abe's steadiness in the
      political views inculcated by Jones. Mrs. Crawford could recollect but a
      single stanza of it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Let auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind, And Jackson
        be our President, And Adams left behind."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the text of "John Anderson's Lamentations,"&mdash;a most distressful
      lyric to begin with,&mdash;Abe was popularly supposed to have interpolated
      some lines of his own, which conclusively attested his genius for poetic
      composition. At all events, he sang it as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "O sinners! poor sinners, take warning by me: The fruits of
        transgression behold now, and see; My soul is tormented, my body
        confined, My friends and dear children left weeping behind. "Much
        intoxication my ruin has been, And my dear companion hath barbarously
        slain: In yonder cold graveyard the body doth lie; Whilst I am
        condemned, and shortly must die. "Remember John Anderson's death, and
        reform Before death overtakes you, and vengeance comes on. My grief's
        overwhelming; in God I must trust: I am justly condemned; my sentence is
        just. "I am waiting the summons in eternity to be hurled; Whilst my poor
        little orphans are cast on the world. I hope my kind neighbors their
        guardeens will be, And Heaven, kind Heaven, protect them and me."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In 1826 Abe's sister Nancy (or Sarah) was married to Aaron Grigsby; and
      the festivities of the occasion were made memorable by a song entitled,
      "Adam and Eve's Wedding Song," which many believed Abe had himself
      composed. The conceits embodied in the doggerel were old before Abe was
      born; but there is some intrinsic as well as extraneous evidence to show
      that the doggerel itself was his. It was sung by the whole Lincoln family,
      before Nancy's marriage and since, but by nobody else in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ADAM AND EVE'S WEDDING SONG. When Adam was created, he dwelt in Eden's
        shade, As Moses has recorded, and soon an Eve was made. Ten thousand
        times ten thousand Of creatures swarmed around Before a bride was
        formed, And yet no mate was found. The Lord then was not willing The man
        should be alone, But caused a sleep upon him, And took from him a bone,
        And closed the flesh in that place of; And then he took the same, And of
        it made a woman, And brought her to the man. Then Adam he rejoiced To
        see his loving bride, A part of his own body, The product of his side.
        This woman was not taken From Adam's feet, we see; So he must not abuse
        her, The meaning seems to be. This woman was not taken From Adam's head,
        we know; To show she must not rule him, 'Tis evidently so. This woman
        she was taken From under Adam's arm; So she must be protected From
        injuries and harm.

      "It was considered at that time," says Mr. Richardson, "that Abe was the
      best penman in the neighborhood. One day, while he was on a visit at my
      mother's, I asked him to write some copies for me. He very willingly
      consented. He wrote several of them, but one of them I have never
      forgotten, although a boy at the time. It was this:&mdash;

    <blockquote>

        'Good boys who to their books apply Will all be great men by and by.'"
      </p>

    <p>
      Here are two original lines from Abe's own copy-book, probably the first
      he ever had, and which must not be confounded with the famous scrap-book
      in which his step-mother, lost in admiration of its contents, declares he
      "entered all things:"&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        "Abraham Lincoln is my name, And with my pen I write the same: I will be
        a good boy, but God knows when."

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The same book contains the following, written at a later day, and with
      nothing to indicate that any part of it was borrowed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Time! what an empty vapor'tis! And days how swift they are! Swift as an
        Indian arrow, Fly on like a shooting-star. The present moment just is
        here, Then slides away in haste, That we can never say they're ours, But
        only say they are past."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Abe wrote many "satires" and "chronicles," which are only remembered in
      fragments by a few old persons in the neighborhood. Even if we had them in
      full, they were most of them too indecent for publication. Such, at least,
      was the character of "a piece" which is said to have been "exceedingly
      humorous and witty," touching a church trial, wherein Brother Harper and
      Sister Gordon were the parties seeking judgment. It was very coarse, but
      it served admirably to raise a laugh in the grocery at the expense of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chronicles were many, and on a great variety of subjects. They were
      written, as his early admirers love to tell us, "in the scriptural style;"
      but those we have betray a very limited acquaintance with the model. In
      these "chapters" was celebrated every event of importance that took place
      in the neighborhood: weddings, fights, Crawford's nose, Sister Gordon's
      innocence, Brother Harper's wit, were all served up, fresh and gross, for
      the amusement of the groundlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles and Reuben Grigsby were married about the same time, and, being
      brothers, returned to their father's house with their brides upon the same
      day. The infare, the feast, the dance, the ostentatious retirement of the
      brides and grooms, were conducted in the old-fashioned way of all new
      countries in the United States, but a way which was bad enough to shock
      Squire Western himself. On this occasion Abe was not invited, and was very
      "mad" in consequence. This indignation found vent in a highly-spiced piece
      of descriptive writing, entitled "The Chronicles of Reuben," which are
      still in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even "The Chronicles," venomous and highly successful as they were,
      were totally insufficient to sate Abe's desire for vengeance on the
      Grigsbys. They were important people about Gentryville, and the social
      slight they had given him stung him bitterly. He therefore began on
      "Billy" in rhyme, after disposing of Charles and Reuben "in scriptural
      style." Mrs. Crawford attempted to repeat these verses to Mr. Herndon; but
      the good old lady had not proceeded far, when she blushed very red, and,
      saying that they were hardly decent, proposed to tell them to her
      daughter, who would tell them to her husband, who would write them down
      and send them to Mr. Herndon. They are probably much curtailed by Mrs.
      Crawford's modesty, but still it is impossible to transcribe them. We give
      what we can to show how the first steps of Abe's fame as a great writer
      were won. It must be admitted that the literary taste of the community in
      which these rhymes were popular could not have been very high.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I will tell you about Joel and Mary: it is neither a joke or a story,
        for Reuben and Charles has married two girls, but Billy has married a
        boy." "The girls he had tried on every side, But none could he get to
        agree: All was in vain; he went home again, And, since that, he is
        married to Natty. "So Billy and Natty agreed very well, And mamma's well
        pleased at the match: The egg it is laid, but Natty's afraid The shell
        is so soft it never will hatch; But Betsey she said, 'You cursed bald
        head, My suitor you never can be; Besides'"&mdash;&mdash;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Abe dropped "The Chronicles" at a point on the road where he was sure one
      of the Grigsbys would find them. The stratagem succeeded, and that
      delicate "satire" produced the desired effect. The Grigsbys were
      infuriated,&mdash;wild with a rage which would be satisfied only when
      Abe's face should be pounded into a jelly, and a couple of his ribs
      cracked by some member of the injured family. Honor, according to the
      Pigeon Creek code, demanded that somebody should be "licked" in expiation
      of an outrage so grievous,&mdash;if not Abe, then some friend of Abe's,
      whom he would depute to stand the brunt in his stead. "Billy," the eldest
      of the brothers, was selected to challenge him. Abe accepted generally;
      that is, agreed that there should be a fight about the matter in question.
      It was accordingly so ordered: the ground was selected a mile and a half
      from Gentryville, a ring was marked out, and the bullies for twenty miles
      around attended. The friends of both parties were present in force, and
      excitement ran high. When the time arrived for the champions to step into
      the ring, Abe displayed his chivalry in a manner that must have struck the
      bystanders with admiration. He announced, that whereas Billy was
      confessedly his inferior in size, shape, and talents, unable to hit with
      pen or fist with any thing like his power, therefore he would forego the
      advantage which the challenge gave him, and "turn over" his stepbrother,
      John Johnston, to do battle in his behalf. If this near relative should be
      sacrificed, he would abide the issue: he was merely anxious to see a fair
      and honorable fight. This proposition was considered highly meritorious,
      and the battle commenced on those general terms. John started out with
      fine pluck and spirit; but in a little while Billy got in some clever
      hits, and Abe began to exhibit symptoms of great uneasiness. Another pass
      or two, and John flagged quite decidedly, and it became evident that Abe
      was anxiously casting about for some pretext to break the ring. At length,
      when John was fairly down, and Billy on top, and all the spectators
      cheering, swearing, and pressing up to the very edge of the ring, Abe
      cried out that "Bill Boland showed foul play," and, bursting out of the
      crowd, seized Grigsby by the heels, and flung him off. Having righted
      John, and cleared the battle-ground of all opponents, "he swung a
      whiskey-bottle over his head, and swore that he was the big buck of the
      lick." It seems that nobody of the Grigsby faction, not one in that large
      assembly of bullies, cared to encounter the sweep of Abe's tremendously
      long and muscular arms; and so he remained master of the "lick." He was
      not content, however, with a naked triumph, but vaunted himself in the
      most offensive manner. He singled out the victorious but cheated Billy,
      and, making sundry hostile demonstrations, declared that he could whip him
      then and there. Billy meekly said "he did not doubt that," but that, if
      Abe would make things even between them by fighting with pistols, he would
      not be slow to grant him a meeting. But Abe replied that he was not going
      "to fool away his life on a single shot;" and so Billy was fain to put up
      with the poor satisfaction he had already received.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Gentryville "they had exhibitions or speaking meetings." Some of the
      questions they spoke on were, The Bee and the Ant, Water and Fire: another
      was, Which had the most right to complain, the Negro or the Indian?
      Another, "Which was the strongest, Wind or Water?"1 The views which Abe
      then entertained on the Indian and the negro question would be intensely
      interesting now. But just fancy him discoursing on wind and water! What
      treasures of natural science, what sallies of humor, he must have wasted
      upon that audience of bumpkins! A little farther on, we shall see that Abe
      made pretensions to an acquaintance with the laws of nature which was
      considered marvellous in that day and generation.

      Dennis Hanks insists that Abe and he became learned men and expert
      disputants, not by a course of judicious reading, but by attending
      "speech-makings, gatherings," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did Lincoln and yourself learn so much in Indiana under such
      disadvantages?" said Mr. Herndon to Dennis, on one of his two oral
      examinations. The question was artfully put; for it touched the jaunty
      Dennis on the side of his vanity, and elicited a characteristic reply. "We
      learned," said he, "by sight, scent, and hearing. We heard all that was
      said, and talked over and over the questions heard; wore them slick,
      greasy, and threadbare. Went to political and other speeches and
      gatherings, as you do now: we would hear all sides and opinions, talk them
      over, discuss them, agreeing or disagreeing. Abe, as I said before, was
      originally a Democrat after the order of Jackson, so was his father, so we
      all were.... He preached, made speeches, read for us, explained to us,
      &amp;c.... Abe was a cheerful boy, a witty boy, was humorous always;
      sometimes would get sad, not very often.... Lincoln would frequently make
      political and other speeches to the boys: he was calm, logical, and clear
      always. He attended trials, went to court always, read the Revised Statute
      of Indiana, dated 1824, heard law speeches, and listened to law trials,
      &amp;c. Lincoln was lazy, a very lazy man. He was always reading,
      scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing poetry, and the like.... In
      Gentryville, about one mile west of Thomas Lincoln's farm, Lincoln would
      go and tell his jokes and stories, &amp;c., and was so odd, original, and
      humorous and witty, that all the people in town would gather around him.
      He would keep them there till midnight. I would get tired, want to go
      home, cuss Abe most heartily. Abe was a good talker, a good reader, and
      was a kind of newsboy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Boonville was the court-house town of Warrick County, and was situated
      about fifteen miles from Gentryville. Thither Abe walked whenever he had
      time to be present at the sittings of the court, where he could learn
      something of public business, amuse himself profitably, and withal pick up
      items of news and gossip, which made him an interesting personage when he
      returned home. During one of these visits he watched, with profound
      attention, the progress of a murder trial, in which a Mr. John
      Breckenridge was counsel for the defence. At the conclusion of the
      latter's speech, Abe, who had listened, literally entranced, accosted the
      man of eloquence, and ventured to compliment him on the success of his
      effort. "Breckenridge looked at the shabby boy" in amazement, and passed
      on his way. But many years afterwards, in 1862, when Abe was President,
      and Breckenridge a resident of Texas, probably needing executive clemency,
      they met a second time; when Abe said, "It was the best speech that I up
      to that time had ever heard. If I could, as I then thought, make as good a
      speech as that, my soul would be satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact, that through all Abe's childhood and boyhood, when
      he seemed to have as little prospect of the Presidency as any boy that
      ever was born, he was in the habit of saying, and perhaps sincerely
      believing, that that great prize would one day be his. When Mrs. Crawford
      reproved him for "fooling," and bedevilling the girls in her kitchen, and
      asked him "what he supposed would ever become of him," he answered that
      "he was going to be President of the United States."1

      Abe usually did the milling for the family, and had the neighbor boy, Dave
      Turnham, for his companion. At first they had to go a long distance, at
      least twelve or thirteen miles, to Hoffman's, on Anderson's Creek; but
      after a while a Mr. Gordon (the husband of Sister Gordon, about whom the
      "witty piece" was written) built a horse-mill within a few miles of the
      Lincolns. Here Abe had come one day with a grist, and Dave probably with
      him. He had duly hitched his "old mare," and started her with great
      impatience; when, just as he was sounding another "cluck," to stir up her
      imperturbable and lazy spirit, she let out with her heels, and laid Abe
      sprawling and insensible on the ground. He was taken up in that condition,
      and did not recover for many minutes; but the first use made of returning
      sense was to finish the interrupted "cluck." He and Mr. Herndon had many
      learned discussions in their quiet little office, at Springfield,
      respecting this remarkable phenomenon, involving so nice a question in
      "psychology."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William Wood, already referred to as "Uncle Wood," was a genuine
      friend and even a patron of Abe's. He lived only about a mile and a half
      from the Lincolns, and frequently had both old Tom and Abe to work for
      him,&mdash;the one as a rough carpenter, and the other as a common
      laborer. He says that Abe was in the habit of carrying "his pieces" to him
      for criticism and encouragement. Mr. Wood took at least two newspapers,&mdash;one
      of them devoted to politics, and one of them to temperance. Abe borrowed
      them both, and, reading them faithfully over and over again, was inspired
      with an ardent desire to write something on the subjects of which they
      treated. He accordingly composed an article on temperance, which Mr. Wood
      thought "excelled, for sound sense, any thing that the paper contained."
      It was forwarded, through the agency of a Baptist preacher, to an editor
      in Ohio, by whom it was published, to the infinite gratification of Mr.
      Wood and his <i>protégé</i>. Abe then tried his hand on "national
      politics," saying that "the American Government was the best form of
      government for an intelligent people; that it ought to be kept sound, and
      preserved forever; that general education should be fostered and carried
      all over the country; that the Constitution should be saved, the Union
      perpetuated, and the laws revered, respected, and enforced." This article
      was consigned, like the other, to Mr. Wood, to be ushered by him before
      the public. A lawyer named Pritchard chanced to pass that way, and, being
      favored with a perusal of Abe's "piece," pithily and enthusiastically
      declared, "The world can't beat it." "He begged for it," and it was
      published in some obscure paper; this new success causing the author a
      most extraordinary access of pride and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in 1828 Abe had become very tired of his home. He was now nineteen
      years of age, and becoming daily more restive under the restraints of
      servitude which bound him. He was anxious to try the world for himself,
      and make his way according to his own notions. "Abe came to my house one
      day," says Mr. Wood, "and stood round about, timid and shy. I knew he
      wanted <i>something</i>, and said to him, 'Abe, what's your case?' He
      replied, 'Uncle, I want you to go to the river, and give me some
      recommendation to some boat.' I remarked, 'Abe, your age is against you:
      you are not twenty yet.' 'I know that, but I want a start,' said Abe. I
      concluded not to go for the boy's good." Poor Abe! old Tom still had a
      claim upon him, which even Uncle Wood would not help him to evade. He must
      wait a few weary months more before he would be of age, and could say he
      was his own man, and go his own way. Old Tom was a hard taskmaster to him,
      and, no doubt, consumed the greater part, if not all, of his wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of March, 1828, Abe went to work for old Mr. Gentry, the
      proprietor of Gentryville. Early in the next month, the old gentleman
      furnished his son Allen with a boat, and a cargo of bacon and other
      produce, with which he was to go on a trading expedition to New Orleans,
      unless the stock was sooner exhausted. Abe, having been found faithful and
      efficient, was employed to accompany the young man as a "bow-hand," to
      work the "front oars." He was paid eight dollars per month, and ate and
      slept on board. Returning, Gentry paid his passage on the deck of a
      steamboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this boat was loading at Gentry's Landing, near Rockport, on the
      Ohio, Abe saw a great deal of the pretty Miss Roby, whom he had saved from
      the wrath of Crawford the schoolmaster, when she failed to spell "defied."
      She says, "Abe was then a long, thin, leggy, gawky boy, dried up and
      shrivelled." This young lady subsequently became the wife of Allen Gentry,
      Abe's companion in the projected voyage. She probably felt a deep interest
      in the enterprise in hand, for the very boat itself seems to have had
      attractions for her. "One evening," says she, "Abe and I were sitting on
      the banks of the Ohio, or rather on the boat spoken of: I said to Abe that
      the sun was going down. He said to me, 'That's not so: it don't really go
      down; it seems so. The earth turns from west to east, and the revolution
      of the earth carries us under as it were: we do the sinking as you call
      it. The sun, as to us, is comparatively still; the sun's sinking is only
      an appearance.' I replied, 'Abe, what a fool you are!' I know now that I
      was the fool, not Lincoln. I am now thoroughly satisfied that Abe knew the
      general laws of astronomy and the movements of the heavenly bodies. He was
      better read then than the world knows, or is likely to know exactly. No
      man could talk to me that night as he did, unless he had known something
      of geography as well as astronomy. He often and often commented or talked
      to me about what he had read,&mdash;seemed to read it out of the book as
      he went along,&mdash;did so to others. He was the learned boy among us
      unlearned folks. He took great pains to explain; could do it so simply. He
      was diffident then too." 1
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip of Gentry and Lincoln was a very profitable one, and Mr. Gentry,
      senior, was highly gratified by the result. Abe displayed his genius for
      mercantile affairs by handsomely putting off on the innocent folks along
      the river some counterfeit money which a shrewd fellow had imposed upon
      Allen. Allen thought his father would be angry with him for suffering
      himself to be cheated; but Abe consoled him with the reflection that the
      "old man" wouldn't care how much bad money they took in the course of
      business if they only brought the proper amount of good money home.2

        1 "When he appeared in company, the boys would gather and cluster around
        him to hear him talk.... Mr. Lincoln was figurative in his speeches,
        talks, and conversations. He argued much from analogy, and explained
        things hard for us to understand by stories, maxims, tales, and figures.
        He would almost always point his lesson or idea by some story that was
        plain and near us, that we might instantly see the force and bearing of
        what he said."&mdash;Nat Grigsby. 2 "Gentry (Allen) was a great personal
        friend of Mr. Lincoln. He was a Democrat, but voted for Lincoln,
        sacrificing his party politics to his friendship. He says that on that
        trip they sold some of their produce at a certain landing, and by
        accident or fraud the bill was paid in counterfeit money. Gentry was
        grieving about it; but Lincoln said, 'Never mind, Allen: it will
        accidentally slip out of our fingers before we get to New Orleans, and
        then old Jim can't quarrel at us.' Sure enough, it all went off like hot
        cakes. I was told this in Indiana by many people about Rockport."&mdash;Herndon.
        It must be remembered that counterfeit money was the principal currency
        along the river at this period.

    <p>
      At Madame Bushane's plantation, six miles below Baton Rouge, they had an
      adventure, which reads strangely enough in the life of the great
      emancipator. The boat was tied up to the shore, in the dead hours of the
      night, and Abe and Allen were fast asleep in the "cabin," in the stern,
      when they were startled by footsteps on board. They knew instantly that it
      was a gang of negroes come to rob, and perhaps to murder them. Allen,
      thinking to frighten the intruders, cried out, "Bring the guns, Lincoln;
      shoot them!" Abe came without a gun, but he fell among the negroes with a
      huge bludgeon, and belabored them most cruelly. Not content with beating
      them off the boat, he and Gentry followed them far back into the country,
      and then, running back to their craft, hastily cut loose and made rapid
      time down the river, fearing lest they should return in greater numbers to
      take revenge. The victory was complete; but, in winning it, Abe received a
      scar which he carried with him to his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he was eighteen years old, he conceived the project of building a
      little boat, and taking the produce of the Lincoln farm down the river to
      market. He had learned the use of tools, and possessed considerable
      mechanical talent, as will appear in some other acts of his life. Of the
      voyage and its results, we have no knowledge; but an incident occurred
      before starting which he related in later life to his Secretary of State,
      Mr. Seward, that made a very marked and pleasant impression upon his
      memory. As he stood at the landing, a steamer approached, coming down the
      river. At the same time two passengers came to the river's bank who wished
      to be taken out to the packet with their luggage. Looking among the boats
      at the landing, they singled out Abraham's, and asked him to scull them to
      the steamer. This he did; and, after seeing them and their trunks on
      board, he had the pleasure of receiving upon the bottom of his boat,
      before he shoved off, a silver half-dollar from each of his passengers. 'I
      could scarcely believe my eyes,' said Mr. Lincoln, in telling the story.
      'You may think it was a very little thing,' continued he, 'but it was a
      most important incident in my life. I could scarcely believe that I, a
      poor boy, had earned a dollar in less than a day. The world seemed wider
      and fairer to me. I was a more hopeful and confident being from that
      time.'"1 If Mr. Lincoln ever made the statement for which Mr. Seward is
      given as authority, he drew upon his imagination for the facts. He may
      have sculled passengers to a steamer when he was ferryman for Taylor, but
      he never made a trip like the one described; never built a boat until he
      went to Illinois; nor did he ever sell produce on his father's account,
      for the good reason that his father had none to sell.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ABE and Gentry returned from New Orleans some time in June, 1828, having
      been gone not quite three months. How much longer he remained in the
      service of Gentry, or whether he remained at all, we are unable to say;
      but he soon took up his old habits, and began to work around among his
      neighbors, or for his father, precisely as he had done before he got his
      partial glimpse of the great world down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall of 1829, Mr. Wood saw him cutting down a large tree in the
      woods, and whip-sawing it into planks. Abe said the lumber was for a new
      house his father was about to build; but Tom Lincoln changed his mind
      before the house was half done, and Abe sold his plank to Josiah Crawford,
      "the book man," who worked them into the south-east room of his house,
      where relic-seekers have since cut pieces from them to make canes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the continued prevalence of that dreadful disease, the
      milk-sickness, with which Nancy Hanks and the Sparrows and the Halls had
      all died, was more than a sufficient reason for a new removal, now in
      contemplation by Thomas Lincoln. Every member of his family, from the
      first settlement in Indiana, except perhaps Abe and himself, had suffered
      with it. The cattle, which, it is true, were of little pecuniary value,
      and raised with great ease and little cost, were swept away by it in great
      numbers throughout the whole neighborhood. It was an awful scourge, and
      common prudence suggested flight. It is wonderful that it took a
      constitutional mover thirteen years to make up his mind to escape from
      it.1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 "What made Thomas Lincoln leave? The reason is this: we were perplexed
        by a disease called milk-sick. I myself being the oldest, I was
        determined to leave, and hunt a country where the milk-sick was not. I
        married his eldest daughter. I sold out, and they concluded to go with
        me. Billy, I was tolerably popular at that time, for I had some money.
        My wife's mother could not think of parting with her, and we ripped up
        stakes, and started to Illinois, and landed at Decatur. This is the
        reason for leaving Indiana. I am to blame for it, if any. As for getting
        more land, this was not the case, for we could have entered ten thousand
        acres of the best land. When we left, it was on account of the milk.
        Billy, I had four good milch cows, too, with it in one week, and eleven
        young calves. This was enough to run me. Besides, liked to have lossed
        my own life with it. This reason was enough (ain't it?) for leaving."&mdash;Dennis
        Hanks.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1830, before the winter had fairly broken up, he and Abe,
      and Dennis Hanks and Levi Hall, with their respective families, thirteen
      in all, took the road for Illinois. Dennis and Levi, as already stated,
      were married to the daughters of Mrs. Lincoln. Hall had one son, and
      Dennis a considerable family of sons and daughters. Sarah (or Nancy)
      Lincoln, who had married Aaron Grigsby, was now dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Hanks had gone to the new country from Kentucky in the fall of 1828,
      and settled near Decatur, whence he wrote Thomas Lincoln all about it, and
      advised him to come there. Dennis, whether because of the persuasions of
      John, or some observations made in a flying trip on his own account, was
      very full of the move, and would hear to no delay. Lincoln sold his farm
      to Gentry, senior, if, indeed, he had not done so before, and his corn and
      hogs to Dave Turnham. The corn brought only ten cents a bushel, and,
      according to the pricelist furnished by Dennis Hanks, the stock must have
      gone at figures equally mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln took with him to Illinois "some stock-cattle, one horse, one
      bureau, one table, one clothes-chest, one set of chairs, cooking utensils,
      clothing," &amp;c. The goods of the three families&mdash;Hanks, Hall, and
      Lincoln&mdash;were loaded on a wagon belonging to Lincoln. This wagon was
      "ironed," a noticeable fact in those primitive days, and "was positively
      the first one that he (Lincoln) ever owned." It was drawn by four yoke of
      oxen,&mdash;two of them Lincoln's, and two of them Hanks's.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no particulars of the journey, except that Abe held the "gad," and
      drove the team; that the mud was very deep, that the spring freshets were
      abroad, and that in crossing the swollen and tumultuous Kaskaskia, the
      wagon and oxen were nearly swept away. On the first day of March, 1830,
      after fifteen days' tedious and heavy travel, they arrived at John Hanks's
      house, four miles north-west of Decatur. Lincoln settled (if any thing he
      did may be called settling) at a point ten miles west of Decatur. Here
      John Hanks had cut some logs in 1829, which he now gave to Lincoln to
      build a house with. With the aid of John, Dennis, Abe, and Hall, a house
      was erected on a small bluff, on the north bank of the north fork of the
      Sangamon. Abe and John took the four yoke of oxen and "broke up" fifteen
      acres of land, and then split rails enough to fence it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe was now over twenty-one. There was no "Uncle Wood to tell him that his
      age was against him:" he had done something more than his duty by his
      father; and, as that worthy was now again placed in a situation where he
      might do well if he chose, Abe came to the conclusion that it was time for
      him to begin life on his own account. It must have cost him some pain to
      leave his good step-mother; but, beyond that, all the old ties were
      probably broken without a single regret. From the moment he was a free
      man, foot-loose, able to go where, and to do what, he pleased, his success
      in those things which lay nearest his heart&mdash;that is, public and
      social preferment&mdash;was astonishing to himself, as well as to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is with great pleasure that we dismiss Tom Lincoln, with his family and
      fortunes, from further consideration in these pages. After Abraham left
      him, he moved at least three times in search of a "healthy" location, and
      finally got himself fixed near Goose Nest Prairie, in Coles County, where
      he died of a disease of the kidneys, in 1851, at the ripe old age of
      seventy-three. The little farm (forty acres) upon which his days were
      ended, he had, with his usual improvidence, mortgaged to the School
      Commissioners for two hundred dollars,&mdash;its full value. Induced by
      love for his step-mother, Abraham had paid the debt, and taken a deed for
      the land, "with a reservation of a life-estate therein, to them, or the
      survivor of them." At the same time (1841), he gave a helping hand to John
      Johnston, binding himself to convey the land to him, or his heirs, after
      the death of "Thomas Lincoln and his wife," upon payment of the two
      hundred dollars, which was really advanced to save John's mother from
      utter penury. No matter how much the land might appreciate in value, John
      was to have it upon these terms, and no interest was to be paid by him,
      "except after the death of the survivor, as aforesaid." This, to be sure,
      was a great bargain for John, but he made haste to assign his bond to
      another person for "fifty dollars paid in hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Abraham got a little up in the world, he began to send his
      step-mother money, and continued to do so until his own death; but it is
      said to have "done her no good," for it only served to tempt certain
      persons about her, and with whom she shared it, to continue in a life of
      idleness. At the close of the Black Hawk War, Mr. Lincoln went to see them
      for a few days, and afterwards, when a lawyer, making the circuits with
      the courts, he visited them whenever the necessities of his practice
      brought him to their neighborhood. He did his best to serve Mrs. Lincoln
      and her son John, but took little notice of his father, although he wrote
      him an exhortation to believe in God when he thought he was on his
      death-bed.
    </p>

      But in regard to the relations between the family and Abe, after the
      latter began to achieve fame and power, nobody can tell the truth more
      clearly, or tell it in a more interesting and suggestive style, than our
      friend Dennis, with whom we are now about to part forever. It will be
      seen, that, when information reached the "Goose Nest Prairie" that Abe was
      actually chosen President of the United States, a general itching for
      public employment broke out among the Hankses, and that an equally general
      disappointment was the result. Doubtless all of them had expectations
      somewhat like Sancho Panza's, when he went to take the government of his
      island, and John Hanks, at least, would not have been disappointed but for
      the little disability which Dennis mentions in the following extract:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Abraham Lincoln treat John D. Johnston well?" "I will say this much
      about it. I think Abe done more for John than he deserved. John thought
      that Abe did not do enough for the old people. They became enemies a while
      on this ground. I don't want to tell all the things that I know: it would
      not look well in history. I say this: Abe treated John well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of a man was Johnston?"&mdash;"I say this much: A
      kinder-hearted man never was in Coles County, Illinois, nor an honester
      man. I don't say this because he was my brother-in-law: I say it, knowing
      it. John did not love to work any the best. I flogged him for not
      working."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Thomas Lincoln treat Abe cruelly?"&mdash;"He loved him. I never could
      tell whether Abe loved his father very well or not. I don't think he did,
      for Abe was one of those forward boys. I have seen his father knock him
      down off the fence when a stranger would, ask the way to a neighbor's
      house. Abe always would have the first word. The old man loved his
      children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did any of the Johnston family ask for office?"&mdash;"No! Thomas
      Johnston went to Abe: he got this permit to take daguerrotypes in the
      army; this is all, for they are all dead except John's boys. They did not
      ask for any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you or John Hanks ask Lincoln for any office?"&mdash;"I say this:
      that John Hanks, of Decatur, did solicit him for an Indian Agency; and
      John told me that Abe as good as told him he should have one. But John
      could not read or write. I think this was the reason that Abe did not give
      John the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for myself, I did not ask Abe right out for an office, only this: I
      would like to have the post-office in Charleston; this was my wife that
      asked him. He told her that much was understood,&mdash;as much as to say
      that I would get it. I did not care much about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think Lincoln cared much for his relations?"&mdash;"I will say
      this much: when he was with us, he seemed to think a great deal of us; but
      I thought sometimes it was hypocritical, but I am not sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe left the Lincoln family late in March, or early in April. He did not
      go far away, but took jobs wherever he could get them, showing that he had
      separated himself from the family, not merely to rove, but to labor, and
      be an independent man. He made no engagement of a permanent character
      during this summer: his work was all done "by the job." If he ever split
      rails for Kirkpatrick, over whom he was subsequently elected captain of a
      volunteer company about to enter the Black Hawk War, it must have been at
      this time; but the story of his work for Kirkpatrick, like that of his
      making "a crap of corn" for Mr. Brown, is probably apocryphal.1 All this
      while he clung close to John Hanks, and either worked where he did, or not
      far away. In the winter following, he was employed by a Major Warrick to
      make rails, and walked daily three miles to his work, and three miles back
      again.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      "After Abe got to Decatur," says John Hanks, "or rather to Macon (my
      country), a man by the name of Posey came into our neighborhood, and made
      a speech: it was a bad one, and I said Abe could beat it. I turned down a
      box, or keg, and Abe made his speech. The other man was a candidate. Abe
      wasn't. Abe beat him to death, his subject being the navigation of the
      Sangamon River. The man, after the speech was through, took Abe aside, and
      asked him where he had learned so much, and how he did so well. Abe
      replied, stating his manner and method of reading, and what he had read.
      The man encouraged Lincoln to persevere."
    </p>
    <p>
      In February, 1831, a Mr. Denton Offutt wanted to engage John Hanks to take
      a flatboat to New Orleans. John was not well disposed to the business; but
      Offutt came to the house, and would take no denial; made much of John's
      fame as a river-man, and at length persuaded him to present the matter to
      Abe and John Johnston. He did so. The three friends discussed the question
      with great earnestness: it was no slight affair to them, for they were all
      young and poor. At length they agreed to Offutt's proposition, and that
      agreement was the turning-point in Abe's career. They were each to receive
      fifty cents a day, and the round sum of sixty dollars divided amongst them
      for making the trip. These were wages such as Abe had never received
      before, and might have tempted him to a much more difficult enterprise.
      When he went with Gentry, the pay was only eight dollars a month, and no
      such company and assistance as he was to have now. But Offutt was lavish
      with his money, and generous bargains like this ruined him a little while
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, Hanks, Johnston, and Lincoln went down the Sangamon in a canoe
      to Jamestown (then Judy's Ferry), five miles east of Springfield. Thence
      they walked to Springfield, and found Mr. Offutt comforting himself at
      "Elliott's tavern in Old Town." He had contracted to have a boat ready at
      the mouth of Spring Creek, but, not looking after it himself, was, of
      course, "disappointed." There was only one way out of the trouble: the
      three hands must build a boat. They went to the mouth of Spring Creek,
      five miles north of Springfield, and there consumed two weeks cutting the
      timber from "Congress land." In the mean time, Abe walked back to Judy's
      Ferry, by way of Springfield, and brought down the canoe which they had
      left at the former place. The timber was hewed and scored, and then
      "rafted down to Saugamon-town." At the mouth of Spring Creek they had been
      compelled to walk a full mile for their meals; but at Sangamon-town they
      built a shanty, and boarded themselves. "Abe was elected cook," and
      performed the duties of the office much to the satisfaction of the party.
      The lumber was sawed at Kirkpatrick's mill, a mile and a half from the
      shanty. Laboring under many disadvantages like this, they managed to
      complete and launch the boat in about four weeks from the time of
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offutt was with the party at this point. He "was a Whig, and so was Abe;
      but he (Abe) could not hear Jackson wrongfully abused, especially where a
      lie and malice did the abuse." Out of this difference arose some disputes,
      which served to enliven the camp, as well as to arouse Abe's ire, and keep
      him in practice in the way of debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days Abe, as usual, is described as being "funny, jokey, full of
      yarns, stories, and rigs;" as being "long, tall, and green," "frequently
      quoting poetry," and "reciting proselike orations." They had their own
      amusements. Abe extracted a good deal of fun out of the cooking; took his
      "dram" when asked to, and played "seven up" at night, at which he made "a
      good game."
    </p>
    <p>
      A juggler gave an exhibition at Sangamontown, in the upper room of Jacob
      Carman's house. Abe went to it, dressed in a suit of rough blue jeans. He
      had on shoes, but the trousers did not reach them by about twelve inches;
      and the naked shin, which had excited John Romine's laughter years ago in
      Indiana, was still exposed. Between the roundabout and the waist of the
      trousers, there was another wide space uncovered; and, considering these
      defects, Mr. Lincoln's attire was thought to be somewhat inelegant, even
      in those times. His hat, however, was a great improvement on coon-skins
      and opossum. It was woollen, broad-brimmed, and low-crowned. In this hat
      the "showman cooked eggs." Whilst Abe was handing it up to him, after the
      man had long solicited a similar favor from the rest of the audience, he
      remarked, "Mister, the reason I didn't give you my hat before was out of
      respect to your eggs, not care for my hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Loaded with barrel-pork, hogs, and corn, the boat set out from
      Sangamontown as soon as finished. Mr. Offutt was on board to act as his
      own merchant, intending to pick up additions to his cargo along the banks
      of the two Illinois rivers down which he was about to pass. On the 19th of
      April they arrived at New Salem, a little village destined to be the scene
      of the seven eventful years of Mr. Lincoln's life, which immediately
      followed the conclusion of the present trip. Just below New Salem the boat
      "stuck," for one night and the better part of a day on Rutledge's
      mill-dam,&mdash;one end of it hanging over the dam, and the other sunk
      deep in the water behind. Here was a case for Abe's ingenuity, and he
      exercised it with effect. Quantities of water were being taken in at the
      stern, the lading was sliding backwards, and every thing indicated that
      the rude craft was in momentary danger of breaking in two, or sinking
      outright. But Abe suggested some unheard-of expedient for keeping it in
      place while the cargo was shifted to a borrowed boat, and then, boring a
      hole in that part of the bottom extending over the dam, he "rigged up" an
      equally strange piece of machinery for tilting and holding it while the
      water ran out. All New Salem was assembled on shore, watching the progress
      of this singular experiment,&mdash;and with one voice affirm that Abe
      saved the boat; although nobody is able to tell us precisely how.1 The
      adventure turned Abe's thoughts to the class of difficulties, one of which
      he had just surmounted; and the result of his reflections was "an improved
      method for lifting vessels over shoals."2 Offutt declared that when he got
      back from New Orleans, he would build a steamboat for the navigation of
      the Sangamon, and make Abe the captain; he would build it with runners for
      ice, and rollers for shoals and dams, for with "Abe in command, by
      thunder, she'd have to go."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 Many persons at New Salem describe in full Abe's conduct on this
        occasion. 2 "Occupying an ordinary and commonplace position in one of
        the show-cases in the targe hall of the Patent Office, is one little
        model which, in ages to come, will be prized as at once one of the most
        curious and one of the most sacred relics in that vast museum of unique
        and priceless things. This is a plain and simple model of a steamboat,
        roughly fashioned in wood, by the hand of Abraham Lincoln. It bears date
        in 1849, when the inventor was known simply as a successful lawyer and
        rising politician of Central Illinois. Neither his practice nor his
        politics took up so much of his time as to prevent him from giving much
        attention to contrivances which he hoped might be of benefit to the
        world, and of profit to himself. "The design of this invention is
        suggestive of one phase of Abraham Lincoln's early life, when he went up
        and down the Mississippi as a flat-boatman, and became familiar with
        some of the dangers and inconveniences attending the navigation of the
        Western rivers. It is an attempt to make it an easy matter to transport
        vessels over shoals and snags, and sawyers. The main idea is that of an
        apparatus resembling a noiseless bellows, placed on each side of the
        hull of the craft, just below the water-line, and worked by an odd but
        not complicated system of ropes, valves, and pulleys. When the keel of
        the vessel grates against the sand or obstruction, these bellows are to
        be filled with air; and, thus buoyed up, the ship is expected to float
        lightly and gayly over the shoal, which would otherwise have proved a
        serious interruption to her voyage. "The model, which is about eighteen
        or twenty inches long, and has the air of having been whittled with a
        knife out of a shingle and a cigar-box, is built without any elaboration
        or ornament, or any extra apparatus beyond that necessary to show the
        operation of buoying the steamer over the obstructions. Herein it
        differs from very many of the models which share with it the shelter of
        the immense halls of the Patent Office, and which are fashioned with
        wonderful nicety and exquisite finish, as if much of the labor and
        thought and affection of a lifetime had been devoted to their
        construction. This is a model of a different kind; carved as one might
        imagine a retired rail-splitter would whittle, strongly, but not
        smoothly, and evidently made with a view solely to convey, by the
        simplest possible means, to the minds of the patent authorities, an idea
        of the purpose and plan of the simple invention. The label on the
        steamer's deck informs us that the patent was obtained; but we do not
        learn that the navigation of the Western rivers was revolutionized by
        this quaint conception. The modest little model has reposed here sixteen
        years; and, since it found its resting-place here on the shelf, the
        shrewd inventor has found it his task to guide the Ship of State over
        shoals more perilous, and obstructions more obstinate, than any prophet
        dreamed of when Abraham Lincoln wrote his bold autograph on the prow of
        this miniature steamer."&mdash; Correspondent Boston Advertiser.

    <p>
      Over the dam, and in the deep pool beyond, they reloaded, and floated down
      to Blue Bank, a mile above the mouth of Salt Creek, where Offutt bought
      some more hogs. But the hogs were wild, and refused to be driven. Abe
      again came to the rescue; and, by his advice, their eyes were sewed up
      with a needle and thread, so that, if the animals fought any more, they
      should do it in the dark. Abe held their heads, and John Hanks their
      tails, while Offutt did the surgery. They were then thrown into a cart,
      whence Abe took them, one by one, in his great arms, and deposited them on
      board.

      From this point they sped very rapidly down the Sangamon and the Illinois.
      Having constructed curious-looking sails of plank, "and sometimes cloth,"
      they were a "sight to see," as they "rushed through Beardstown," where
      "the people came out and laughed at them." They swept by Alton and Cairo,
      and other considerable places, without tying up, but stopped at Memphis,
      Vicksburg, and Natchez.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time they arrived at New Orleans. "There it was," says John Hanks,
      "we saw negroes chained, maltreated, whipped, and scourged. Lincoln saw
      it; his heart bled, said nothing much, was silent from feeling, was sad,
      looked bad, felt bad, was thoughtful and abstracted. I can say, knowing
      it, that it was on this trip that he formed his opinions of slavery. It
      run its iron in him then and there,&mdash;May, 1831. I have heard him say
      so often and often."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in June the party took passage on a steamboat going up the
      river, and remained together until they reached St. Louis, where Offutt
      left them, and Abe, Hanks, and Johnston started on foot for the interior
      of Illinois. At Edwardsville, twenty-five miles out, Hanks took the road
      to Springfield, and Abe and Johnston took that to Coles County, where Tom
      Lincoln had moved since Abraham's departure from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe never worked again in company with his friend and relative, good old
      John Hanks. Here their paths separated: Abe's began to ascend the heights,
      while John's continued along the common level. They were in the Black Hawk
      War during the same campaign, but not in the same division. But they
      corresponded, and, from 1833, met at least once a year, until Abe was
      elected President. Then Abe, delighting to honor those of his relatives
      who were worthy of it, invited John to go with him to see his step-mother.
      John also went to the inauguration at Washington, and tells, with
      pardonable pride, how he "was in his [Abe's] rooms several times." He then
      retired to his old home in Macon County, until the assassination and the
      great funeral, when he came to Springfield to look in the blackened face
      of his old friend, and witness the last ceremonies of his splendid burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Abe reached Coles County, and begun to think what next to
      turn his hand to, when he received a visit from a famous wrestler, one
      Daniel Needham, who regarded him as a growing rival, and had a fancy to
      try him a fall or two. He considered himself "the best man" in the
      country, and the report of Abe's achievements filled his big breast with
      envious pains. His greeting was friendly and hearty, but his challenge was
      rough and peremptory. Abe valued his popularity among "the boys" too
      highly to decline it, and met him by public appointment in the
      "greenwood," at Wabash Point, where he threw him twice with so much ease
      that Needham's pride was more hurt than his body. "Lincoln," said he, "you
      have thrown me twice, but you can't whip me."&mdash;"Needham," replied
      Abe, "are you satisfied that I can throw you? If you are not, and must be
      convinced through a threshing, I will do that, too, for your sake."
      Needham had hoped that the youngster would shrink from the extremity of a
      fight with the acknowledged "bully of the patch;" but finding him willing,
      and at the same time magnanimously inclined to whip him solely for his <i>own
      good</i>, he concluded that a bloody nose and a black eye would be the
      reverse of soothing to his feelings, and therefore surrendered the field
      with such grace as he could command.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the west bank of the Sangamon River, twenty miles north-west of
      Springfield, a traveller on his way to Havana will ascend a bluff one
      hundred feet higher than the low-water mark of the stream. On the summit
      he Will find a solitary log-hut. The back-bone of the ridge is about two
      hundred and fifty feet broad where it overlooks the river; but it widens
      gradually as it extends westerly toward the remains of an old forest,
      until it terminates in a broad expanse of meadow. On either side of this
      hill, and skirting its feet north and south, run streams of water in very
      deep channels, and tumble into the Sangamon almost within hearing. The
      hill, or more properly the bluff, rises from the river in an almost
      perpendicular ascent. "There is an old mill at the foot of the bluff,
      driven by water-power. The river washes the base of the bluff for about
      four hundred yards, the hill breaking off almost abruptly at the north.
      The river along this line runs about due north: it strikes the bluff
      coming around a sudden bend from the south-east, the river being checked
      and turned by the rocky hill. The mill-dam running across the Sangamon
      River just at the mill checks the rapidity of the water. It was here, and
      on this dam, that Mr. Lincoln's flatboat 'stuck on the 19th of April,
      1831.' The dam is about eight feet high, and two hundred and twenty feet
      long, and, as the old Sangamon rolls her turbid waters over the dam,
      plunging them into the whirl and eddy beneath, the roar and hiss of
      waters, like the low, continuous, distant thunder, can be distinctly heard
      through the whole village, day and night, week-day and Sunday, spring and
      fall, or other high-water time. The river, at the base of the bluff, is
      about two hundred and fifty feet wide, the mill using up thirty feet,
      leaving the dam only about two hundred and twenty feet long."
    </p>
    <p>
      In every direction but the West, the country is broken into hills or
      bluffs, like the one we are attempting to describe, which are washed by
      the river, and the several streams that empty into it in the immediate
      vicinity. Looking across the river from bluff to bluff, the distance is
      about a thousand yards; while here and there, on both banks, are patches
      of rich alluvial bottom-lands, eight or nine hundred yards in width,
      enclosed on one side by the hills, and on the other by the river. The
      uplands of the eastern bank are covered with original forests of
      immemorial age; and, viewed from "Salem Hill," the eye ranges over a vast
      expanse of green foliage, the monotony of which is relieved by the
      alternating swells and depressions of the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ridge of that hill, where the solitary cabin now stands, there was
      a few years ago a pleasant village. How it vanished like a mist of the
      morning, to what distant places its inhabitants dispersed, and what became
      of the dwellings they left behind, shall be questions for the local
      antiquarian. We have no concern with any part of the history, except that
      part which began in the summer of 1831 and ended in 1837,&mdash;the period
      during which it had the honor of sheltering a man whose enduring fame
      contrasts strangely with the evanescence of the village itself.

    <p>
      In 1829 James Rutledge and John Cameron built the mill on the Sangamon,
      and laid off the town on the hill. The place was then called Cameron's
      Mill; but in process of time, as cabins, stores, and groceries were added,
      it was dignified by the name of New Salem. "I claim," says one of the
      gentlemen who established the first store, "to be the explorer and
      discoverer of New Salem as a business point. Mr. Hill (now dead) and
      myself purchased some goods at Cincinnati, and shipped them to St. Louis,
      whence I set out on a voyage of discovery on the prairies of Illinois....
      I, however, soon came across a noted character who lives in this vicinity,
      by the name of Thomas Wadkins, who set forth the beauties and other
      advantages of Cameron's Mill, as it was then called. I accordingly came
      home with him, visited the locality, contracted for the erection of a
      magnificent storehouse for the sum of fifteen dollars; and, after passing
      a night in the prairie, reached St. Louis in safety. Others soon
      followed."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1836 New Salem contained about twenty houses, inhabited by nearly a
      hundred people; but in 1831 there could not have been more than two-thirds
      or three-fourths that number. Many of the houses cost not more than ten
      dollars, and none of them more than one hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news flew through the country that the mill-dam was broken, the
      people assembled from far and near, and made a grand frolic of mending it.
      In like manner, when a new settler arrived, and the word passed around
      that he wanted to put up a house, everybody came in to the "raising;" and,
      after behaving like the best of good Samaritans to the new neighbor, they
      drank whiskey, ran foot-races, wrestled, fought, and went home.

      "I first knew this hill, or bluff," says Mr. Herndon, in his remarkable
      lecture on Ann Rutledge, "as early as 1829. I have seen it in spring-time
      and winter, in summer-time and fall. I have seen it in daylight and
      night-time; have seen it when the sward was green, living, and vital; and
      I have seen it wrapped in snow, frost, and sleet. I have closely studied
      it for more than five long years....

      "As I sat on the verge of the town, in presence of its ruins, I called to
      mind the street running east and west through the village, the river
      eastward; Green's Rocky Branch, with its hills, southward; Clary's Grove,
      westerly about three miles; Petersburg northward, and Springfield
      south-east; and now I cannot exclude from my memory or imagination the
      forms, faces, voices, and features of those I once knew so well. In my
      imagination the village perched on the hill is astir with the hum of busy
      men, and the sharp, quick buzz of women; and from the country come men and
      women on foot or on horseback, to see and be seen, to hear and to be
      heard, to barter and exchange what they have with the merchant and the
      laborer. There are Jack Armstrong and William Green, Kelso and Jason
      Duncan, Alley and Carman, Hill and McNamar, Herndon and Rutledge,
      Warburton and Sincho, Bale and Ellis, Abraham and Ann. Oh, what a
      history!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days, which in the progressive West would be called ancient days,
      New Salem was in Sangamon County, with Springfield as the county-seat.
      Springfield itself was still a mere village, having a population of one
      thousand, or perhaps eleven hundred. The capital of the State was yet at
      Vandalia, and waited for the parliamentary tact of Abraham Lincoln and the
      "long nine" to bring it to Springfield. The same influence, which, after
      long struggles, succeeded in removing the capital, caused the new County
      of Menard to be erected out of Sangamon in 1839, of which Petersburg was
      made the county-seat, and within which is included the barren site of New
      Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July or August, 1831, Mr. Lincoln made his second appearance at New
      Salem. He was again in company with Denton Offutt, who had collected some
      goods at Beardstown, and now proposed to bring them to this place. Mr.
      Lincoln undoubtedly came there in the service of Offutt, but whilst the
      goods were being transported from Beardstown he seemed to be idling about
      without any special object in view. Many persons who saw him then for the
      first time speak of him as "doing nothing." He has given some
      encouragement to this idea himself by the manner in which he habitually
      spoke of his advent there,&mdash;describing himself as coming down the
      river after the winter of the deep snow, like a piece of "floating
      driftwood" borne along by the freshet, and accidentally lodged at New
      Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the election, in the month of August, as Minter Graham, the
      school-teacher, tells us, Abe was seen loitering about the polling-place.
      It must have been but a few days after his arrival in the town, for nobody
      knew that he could write. They were "short of a clerk" at the polls; and,
      after casting about in vain for some one competent to fill the office, it
      occurred to one of the judges that perhaps the tall stranger possessed the
      needful qualifications. He thereupon accosted him, and asked if he could
      write. He replied, "Yes, a little."&mdash;"Will you act as clerk of the
      election today?" said the judge. "I will try," returned Abe, "and do the
      best I can, if you so request." He did try accordingly, and, in the
      language of the schoolmaster, "performed the duties with great facility,
      much fairness and honesty and impartiality. This was the first public
      official act of his life. I clerked with him," says Mr. Graham, swelling
      with his theme, "on the same day and at the same polls. The election-books
      are now in the city of Springfield, Ill., where they can be seen and
      inspected any day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Abe was "doing nothing," or, in other words, waiting for Offutt's
      goods, one Dr. Nelson, a resident of New Salem, built a flatboat, and,
      placing his family and effects upon it, started for Texas. But as the
      Sangamon was a turbulent and treacherous stream at best, and its banks
      were now full to overflowing, Nelson needed a pilot, at least as far as
      Beardstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      His choice fell upon Abe, who took him to the mouth of the doubtful river
      in safety, although Abe often declared that he occasionally ran out into
      the prairie at least three miles from the channel. Arriving at Beardstown,
      Nelson pushed on down the Illinois, and Abe walked back to New Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second storekeeper at New Salem was a Mr. George Warburton; but, "the
      country not having improved his morals in the estimation of his friends,"
      George thought it advisable to transfer his storeroom and the remnant of
      his stock to Offutt. In the mean time, Offutt's long-expected goods were
      received from Beardstown. Abe unpacked them, ranged them on the shelves,
      rolled the barrels and kegs into their places, and, being provided with a
      brand-new book, pen, and ink, found himself duly installed as "first
      clerk" of the principal mercantile house in New Salem. A country store is
      an indescribable collection of miscellanies,&mdash;groceries, drygoods,
      hardware, earthenware, and stoneware, cups and saucers, plates and dishes,
      coffee and tea, sugar and molasses, boots and shoes, whiskey and lead,
      butter and eggs, tobacco and gunpowder, with an endless list of things
      unimaginable except by a housewife or a "merchant." Such was the store to
      the charge of which Abe was now promoted,&mdash;promoted from the rank of
      a common laborer to be a sort of brevet clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Offutt's ideas of commerce were very comprehensive; and, as "his
      business was already considerably scattered about the country," he thought
      he would scatter a little more. He therefore rented the mill at the foot
      of the hill, from Cameron and Rutledge, and set Abe to overlooking that as
      well as the store. This increase of business, however, required another
      clerk, and in a few days Abe was given a companion in the person of W. G.
      Green. They slept together on the same cot in the store; and as Mr. Green
      observes, by way of indicating the great intimacy that subsisted between
      them, "when one turned over, the other had to do so likewise." To complete
      his domestic arrangements, Abe followed the example of Mr. Offutt, and
      took boarding at John Cameron's, one of the owners of the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Offutt is variously, though not differently, described as a "wild,
      harum-scarum, reckless fellow;" a "gusty, windy, brain-rattling man;" a
      "noisy, unsteady, fussy, rattlebrained man, wild and improvident." If
      anybody can imagine the character indicated by these terms, he can imagine
      Mr. Offutt,&mdash;Abe's employer, friend, and patron. Since the trip on
      the flatboat, his admiration for Abe had grown to be boundless. He now
      declared that "Abe knew more than any man in the United States;" that "he
      would some day be President of the United States," and that he could, at
      that present moment, outrun, whip, or throw down any man in Sangamon
      County. These loud boasts were not wasted on the desert air: they were bad
      seed sown in a rank soil, and speedily raised up a crop of sharp thorns
      for both Abe and Offutt. At New Salem, honors such as Offutt accorded to
      Abe were to be won before they were worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Clary made light of Offutt's opinion respecting Abe's prowess; and
      one day, when the dispute between them had been running high in the store,
      it ended by a bet of ten dollars on the part of Clary that Jack Armstrong
      was "a better man." Now, "Jack was a powerful twister," "square built, and
      strong as an ox." He had, besides, a great backing; for he was the chief
      of the "Clary's Grove boys," and the Clary's Grove boys were the terror of
      the countryside. Although there never was under the sun a more generous
      parcel of ruffians than those over whom Jack held sway, a stranger's
      introduction was likely to be the most unpleasant part of his acquaintance
      with them. In fact, one of the objects of their association was to
      "initiate or naturalize new-comers," as they termed the amiable
      proceedings which they took by way of welcoming any one ambitious of
      admittance to the society of New Salem. They first bantered the gentleman
      to run a foot-race, jump, pitch the mall, or wrestle; and, if none of
      these propositions seemed agreeable to him, they would request to know
      what he would do in case another gentleman should pull his nose, or squirt
      tobacco-juice in his face. If he did not seem entirely decided in his
      views as to what should properly be done in such a contingency, perhaps he
      would be nailed in a hogshead, and rolled down New-Salem hill; perhaps his
      ideas would be brightened by a brief ducking in the Sangamon; or perhaps
      he would be scoffed, kicked, and cuffed by a great number of persons in
      concert, until he reached the confines of the village, and then turned
      adrift as being unfit company for the people of that settlement. If,
      however, the stranger consented to engage in a tussle with one of his
      persecutors, it was usually arranged that there should be "foul play,"
      with nameless impositions and insults, which would inevitably change the
      affair into a fight; and then, if the subject of all these practices
      proved indeed to be a man of mettle, he would be promptly received into
      "good society," and in all probability would never have better friends on
      earth than the roystering fellows who had contrived his torments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far Abe had managed to escape "initiation" at the hands of Jack and
      his associates. They were disposed to like him, and to take him on faith,
      or at least to require no further evidence of his manhood than that which
      rumor had already brought them. Offutt, with his busy tongue, had spread
      wide the report of his wondrous doings on the river; and, better still,
      all New Salem, including many of the "Clary's Grove boys," had witnessed
      his extraordinary feats of strength and ingenuity at Rutledge's mill-dam.
      It was clear that no particular person was "spoiling" for a collision with
      him; and an exception to the rule might have been made in his favor, but
      for the offensive zeal and confidence of his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example of Offutt and Clary was followed by all the "boys;" and money,
      knives, whiskey, and all manner of things, were staked on the result of
      the wrestle. The little community was excited throughout, and Jack's
      partisans were present in great numbers; while Offutt and Bill Green were
      about the only persons upon whom Abe could rely if the contest should take
      the usual turn, and end in a fight. For these, and many other reasons, he
      longed to be safely and honorably out of the scrape; but Offutt's folly
      had made it impossible for him to evade the conflict without incurring the
      imputation, and suffering the penalties, of cowardice. He said, "I never
      tussle and scuffle, and I will not: I don't like this wooling and
      pulling." But these scruples only served to aggravate his case; and he was
      at last forced to take hold of Jack, which he did with a will and power
      that amazed the fellows who had at last baited him to the point of
      indignation. They took "side holds," and stood struggling, each with
      tremendous but equal strength, for several minutes, without any
      perceptible advantage to either. New trips or unexpected twists were of no
      avail between two such experienced wrestlers as these. Presently Abe
      profited by his height and the length of his arms to lift Jack clear off
      the ground, and, swinging him about, thought to land him on his back; but
      this feat was as futile as the rest, and left Jack standing as square and
      as firm as ever. "Now, Jack," said Abe, "let's quit: you can't throw me,
      and I can't throw you." But Jack's partisans, regarding this overture as a
      signal of the enemy's distress, and being covetous of jack-knives,
      whiskey, and "smooth quarters," cheered him on to greater exertions.
      Rendered desperate by these expectations of his friends, and now enraged
      at meeting more than his match, Jack resolved on "a foul," and, breaking
      holds, he essayed the unfair and disreputable expedient of "legging." But
      at this Abe's prudence deserted him, and righteous wrath rose to the
      ascendent. The astonished spectators saw him take their great bully by the
      throat, and, holding him out at arm's-length, shake him like a child. Then
      a score or two of the boys cried "Fight!" Bill Clary claimed the stakes,
      and Offutt, in the fright and confusion, was about to yield them; but
      "Lincoln said they had not won the money, and they should not have it;
      and, although he was opposed to fighting, if nothing else would do them,
      he would fight Armstrong, Clary, or any of the set." Just at this juncture
      James Rutledge, the original proprietor of New Salem, and a man of some
      authority, "rushed into the crowd," and exerted himself to maintain the
      peace. He succeeded; but for a few moments a general fight was impending,
      and Abe was seen with his back against Offutt's store "undismayed" and
      "resolute," although surrounded by enemies.1

    <p>
      Jack Armstrong was no bad fellow, after all. A sort of Western John
      Browdie, stout and rough, but great-hearted, honest, and true: his big
      hand, his cabin, his table, and his purse were all at the disposal of a
      friend in need. He possessed a rude sense of justice, and felt an
      incredible respect for a man who would stand single-handed, stanch, and
      defiant, in the midst of persecutors and foes. He had never disliked Abe,
      and had, in fact, looked for very clever things from him, even before his
      title to respectability had been made so incontestably clear; but his
      exhibition of pluck and muscle on this occasion excited Jack to a degree
      of admiration far beyond his power to conceal it. Abe's hand was hardly
      removed from his throat, when he was ready to grasp it in friendship, and
      swear brotherhood and peace between them. He declared him, on the spot,
      "the best fellow that ever broke into their settlement;" and henceforth
      the empire was divided, and Jack and Abe reigned like two friendly Cæsars
      over the roughs and bullies of New Salem. If there were ever any
      dissensions between them, it was because Jack, in the abundance of his
      animal spirits, was sometimes inclined to be an oppressor, whilst Abe was
      ever merciful and kind; because Jack would occasionally incite the "boys"
      to handle a stranger, a witless braggart, or a poor drunkard with a
      harshness that shocked the just and humane temper of his friend, who was
      always found on the side of the weak and the unfortunate. On the whole,
      however, the harmony that subsisted between them was wonderful. Wherever
      Lincoln worked, Jack "did his loafing;" and, when Lincoln was out of work,
      he spent days and weeks together at Jack's cabin, where Jack's jolly wife,
      "old Hannah," stuffed him with bread and honey, laughed at his ugliness,
      and loved him for his goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe rapidly grew in favor with the people in and around New Salem, until
      nearly everybody thought quite as much of him as Mr. Offutt did. He was
      decidedly the most popular man that ever lived there. He could do more to
      quell a riot, compromise a feud; and keep peace among the neighbors
      generally, than any one else; and these were of the class of duties which
      it appears to have been the most agreeable for him to perform. One day a
      strange man came into the settlement, and was straightway beset by the
      same fellows who had meditated a drubbing for Abe himself. Jack Armstrong,
      of course, "had a difficulty with him;" "called him a liar, coward," and
      various other names not proper for print; but the man, finding himself
      taken at a disadvantage, "backed up to a woodpile," got a stick, and
      "struck Jack a blow that brought him to the ground." Being "as strong as
      two men, Jack wanted to whip the man badly," but Abe interfered, and,
      managing to have himself made "arbitrator," compromised the difficulty by
      a practical application of the golden rule. "Well, Jack," said he, "what
      did you say to the man?" Whereupon Jack repeated his words. "Well, Jack,"
      replied Abe, "if you were a stranger in a strange place, as this man is,
      and you were called a d&mdash;d liar, &amp;c., what would you do?"&mdash;"Whip
      him, by God!"&mdash;"Then this man has done no more to you than you would
      have done to him."&mdash;"Well, Abe," said the honest bruiser, "it's all
      right," and, taking his opponent by the hand, forgave him heartily, and
      "treated." Jack always treated his victim when he thought he had been too
      hard upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe's duties in Offutt's store were not of a character to monopolize the
      whole of his time,1 and he soon began to think that here was a fine
      opportunity to remedy some of the defects in his education.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 "During the time he was working for Offutt, and hands being scarce,
        Lincoln turned In and cut down trees, and split enough rails for Offutt
        to make a pen sufficiently large to contain a thousand hogs. The pen was
        built under New Salem hill, close to the mill.... I know where those
        rails are now; are sound to-day."&mdash;Minter Graham
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He could read, write, and cipher as well as most men; but as his
      popularity was growing daily, and his ambition keeping pace, he feared
      that he might shortly be called to act in some public capacity which would
      require him to speak his own language with some regard to the rules of the
      grammar,&mdash;of which, according to his own confession, he knew nothing
      at all. He carried his troubles to the schoolmaster, saying, "I have a
      notion to study English grammar."&mdash;"If you expect to go before the
      public in any capacity," replied Mr. Graham, "I think it the best thing
      you can do."&mdash;"If I had a grammar," replied Abe, "I would commence
      now." There was no grammar to be had about New Salem; but the
      schoolmaster, having kept the run of that species of property, gladdened
      Abe's heart by telling him that he knew where there was one. Abe rose from
      the breakfast at which he was sitting, and learning that the book was at
      Vaner's, only six miles distant, set off after it as hard as he could
      tramp. It seemed to Mr. Graham a very little while until he returned and
      announced, with great pleasure, that he had it. "He then turned his
      immediate and most undivided attention" to the study of it. Sometimes,
      when business was not particularly brisk, he would lie under a shade-tree
      in front of the store, and pore over the book; at other times a customer
      would find him stretched on the counter intently engaged in the same way.
      But the store was a bad place for study; and he was often seen quietly
      slipping out of the village, as if he wished to avoid observation, when,
      if successful in getting off alone, he would spend hours in the woods,
      "mastering a book," or in a state of profound abstraction. He kept up his
      old habit of sitting up late at night; but, as lights were as necessary to
      his purpose as they were expensive, the village cooper permitted him to
      sit in his shop, where he burnt the shavings, and kept a blazing fire to
      read by, when every one else was in bed. The Greens lent him books; the
      schoolmaster gave him instructions in the store, on the road, or in the
      meadows: every visitor to New Salem who made the least pretension to
      scholarship was waylaid by Abe, and required to explain something which he
      could not understand. The result of it all was, that the village and the
      surrounding country wondered at his growth in knowledge, and he soon
      became as famous for the goodness of his understanding as for the muscular
      power of his body, and the unfailing humor of his talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the spring of 1832, some enterprising gentlemen at Springfield
      determined to try whether the Sangamon was a navigable stream or not. It
      was a momentous question to the dwellers along the banks; and, when the
      steamboat "Talisman" was chartered to make the experiment, the popular
      excitement was intense, and her passage up and down was witnessed by great
      concourses of people on either bank. It was thought that Abe's experience
      on this particular river would render his assistance very valuable; and,
      in company with some others, he was sent down to Beardstown, to meet the
      "Talisman," and pilot her up. With Abe at the helm, she ran with
      comparative ease and safety as far as the New-Salem dam, a part of which
      they were compelled to tear away in order to let the steamer through.
      Thence she went on as high as Bogue's mill; but, having reached that
      point, the rapidly-falling water admonished her captain and pilots, that,
      unless they wished her to be left there for the season, they must promptly
      turn her prow down stream. For some time, on the return trip, she made not
      more than three or four miles a day, "on account of the high wind from the
      prairie." "I was sent for, being an old boatman," says J. R. Herndon, "and
      I met her some twelve or thirteen miles above New Salem.... We got to
      Salem the second day after I went on board. When we struck the dam, she
      hung. We then backed off, and threw the anchor over the dam, and tore away
      a part of the dam, and, raising steam, ran her over the first trial. As
      soon as she was over, the company that chartered her was done with her. I
      think the captain gave Mr. Lincoln forty dollars to run her down to
      Beardstown. I am sure I got forty dollars to continue on her until we
      landed at Beardstown. We that went down with her walked back to New
      Salem."

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the spring of 1832, Mr. Offutt's business had gone to ruin: the store
      was sold out, the mill was handed over to its owners, Mr. Offutt himself
      departed for parts unknown, and his "head clerk" was again out of work.
      Just about that time a governor's proclamation arrived, calling for
      volunteers to meet the famous chief Black Hawk and his warriors, who were
      preparing for a grand, and, in all likelihood, a bloody foray, into their
      old hunting-grounds in the Rock-river country.

    <p>
      Black Hawk was a large Indian, of powerful frame and commanding presence.
      He was a soldier and a statesman. The history of his diplomacy with the
      tribes he sought to confederate shows that he expected to realize on a
      smaller scale the splendid plans of Pontiac and Tecumseh. In his own
      tongue he was eloquent, and dreamed dreams which, amongst the Indians,
      passed for prophecy. The prophet is an indispensable personage in any
      comprehensive scheme of Indian politics, and no chief has ever effected a
      combination of formidable strength without his aid. In the person of Black
      Hawk, the chief and the prophet were one. His power in both capacities was
      bent toward a single end,&mdash;the great purpose of his life,&mdash;the
      recovery of his birthplace and the ancient home of his people from the
      possession of the stranger.

      Black Hawk was born on the Rock River in Wisconsin, in the year 1767. His
      grandfather lived near Montreal, whence his father Pyesa had emigrated,
      but not until he had become thoroughly British in his views and feelings.
      All his life long he made annual journeys to the councils of the tribes at
      Malden, where the gifts and persuasions of British agents confirmed him in
      his inclination to the British interests. When Pyesa was gathered to his
      fathers, his son took his place as the chief of the Sacs, hated the
      Americans, loved the friendly English, and went yearly to Malden,
      precisely as he thought Pyesa would have had him do. But Black Hawk's mind
      was infinitely superior to Pyesa's: his sentiments were loftier, his heart
      more susceptible; he had the gift of the seer, the power of the orator,
      with the high courage and the profound policy of a born warrior and a
      natural ruler. He "had brooded over the early history of his tribe; and to
      his views, as he looked down the vista of years, the former times seemed
      so much better than the present, that the vision wrought upon his
      susceptible imagination, which pictured it to be the Indian golden age. He
      had some remembrance of a treaty made by Gen. Harrison in 1804, to which
      his people had given their assent; and his feelings were with difficulty
      controlled, when he was required to leave the Rock-river Valley, in
      compliance with a treaty made with Gen. Scott. That valley, however, he
      peacefully abandoned with his tribe, on being notified, and went to the
      west of the Mississippi; but he had spent his youth in that locality, and
      the more he thought of it, the more determined he was to return thither.
      He readily enlisted the sympathies of the Indians, who are ever prone to
      ponder on their real or imaginary wrongs; and it may be readily
      conjectured that what Indian counsel could not accomplish, Indian prophecy
      would."1 He had moved when summoned to move, because he was then
      unprepared to fight; but he utterly denied that the chiefs who seemed to
      have ceded the lands long years before had any right to cede them, or that
      the tribe had ever willingly given up the country to the stranger and the
      aggressor. It was a fraud upon the simple Indians: the old treaty was a
      great lie, and the signatures it purported to have, made with marks and
      primitive devices, were not attached in good faith, and were not the names
      of honest Sacs. No: he would go over the river, he would have his own; the
      voice of the Great Spirit was in the air wherever he went; it was in his
      lodge through all the night-time, and it said "Go;" and Black Hawk must
      needs rise up and tell the people what the voice said.

    <p>
      It was by such arguments as these that Black Hawk easily persuaded the
      Sacs. But hostilities by the Sacs alone would be a hopeless adventure. He
      must find allies. He looked first to their kindred, the Foxes, who had
      precisely the same cause of war with the Sacs, and after them to the
      Winnebagoes, Sioux, Kickapoos, and many others. That Black Hawk was a wise
      and valiant leader, all the Indians conceded; and his proposals were heard
      by some of the tribes with eagerness, and by all of them with respect. At
      one time his confederacy embraced nine tribes,&mdash;the most formidable
      in the North-west, if we exclude the Sioux and the Chippewas, who were
      themselves inclined to accede. Early in 1831, the first chief of the
      Chippewas exhibited a miniature tomahawk, red with vermilion, which,
      having been accepted from Black Hawk, signified an alliance between them;
      and away up at Leech. Lake, an obscure but numerous band showed some
      whites a few British medals painted in imitation of blood, which meant
      that they were to follow the war-paths of Black Hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1831 Black Hawk had crossed the river in small force, but had retired
      before the advance of Gen. Gaines, commanding the United States post at
      Rock Island. He then promised to remain on the other side, and to keep
      quiet for the future. But early in the spring of 1832 he re-appeared with
      greater numbers, pushed straight into the Rock-river Valley, and said he
      had "come to plant corn." He was now sixty-seven years of age: he thought
      his great plots were all ripe, and his allies fast and true. They would
      fight a few bloody battles, and then he would sit down in his old age and
      see the corn grow where he had seen it in his youth. But the old chief
      reckoned too much upon Indian fidelity: he committed the fatal error of
      trusting to their patriotism instead of their interests. Gen. Atkinson,
      now in command at Rock Island, set the troops in motion: the governor
      issued his call for volunteers; and, as the Indians by this time had
      committed some frightful barbarities, the blood of the settlers was
      boiling, and the regiments were almost instantly filled with the best
      possible material. So soon as these facts became known, the allies of
      Black Hawk, both the secret and the open, fell away from him, and left
      him, with the Sacs and the Foxes, to meet his fate.

      In the mean time Lincoln had enlisted in a company from Sangamon. He had
      not been out in the campaign of the previous year, but told his friend Row
      Herndon, that, if he had not been down the river with Offutt, he would
      certainly have been with the boys in the field. But, notwithstanding his
      want of military experience, his popularity was so great, that he had been
      elected captain of a militia company on the occasion of a muster at
      Clary's Grove the fall before. He was absent at the time, but thankfully
      accepted and served. Very much to his surprise, his friends put him up for
      the captaincy of this company about to enter active service. They did not
      organize at home, however, but marched first to Beardstown, and then to
      Rushville in Schuyler County, where the election took place. Bill
      Kirkpatrick was a candidate against Lincoln, but made a very sorry
      showing. It has been said that Lincoln once worked for Kirkpatrick as a
      common laborer, and suffered some indignities at his hands; but the story
      as a whole is supported by no credible testimony. It is certain, however,
      that the planks for the boat built by Abe and his friends at the mouth of
      Spring Creek were sawed at the mill of a Mr. Kirkpatrick. It was then,
      likely enough, that Abe fell in the way of this man, and learned to
      dislike him. At all events, when he had distanced Kirkpatrick, and was
      chosen his captain by the suffrages of men who had been intimate with
      Kirkpatrick long before they had ever heard of Abe, he spoke of him
      spitefully, and referred in no gentle terms to some old dispute. "Damn
      him," said he to Green, "I've beat him: he used me badly in our settlement
      for my toil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Lincoln now made a very modest speech to his comrades, reciting the
      exceeding gratification their partiality afforded him, how undeserved he
      thought it, and how wholly unexpected it was. In conclusion, "he promised
      very plainly that he would do the best he could to prove himself worthy of
      that confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops rendezvoused at Beardstown and Rushville were formed into four
      regiments and a spy battalion. Capt. Lincoln's company was attached to the
      regiment of Col. Samuel Thompson. The whole force was placed under the
      command of Gen. Whiteside, who was accompanied throughout the campaign by
      the governor in person.

    <p>
      On the 27th of April, the army marched toward the mouth of Rock River, by
      way of Oquaka on the Mississippi. The route was one of difficulty and
      danger, a great part of it lying through a country largely occupied by the
      enemy. The men were raw, and restive under discipline. In the beginning
      they had no more respect for the "rules and regulations" than for
      Solomon's Proverbs, or the Westminster Confession. Capt. Lincoln's company
      is said to have been a particularly "hard set of men," who recognized no
      power but his. They were fighting men, and but for his personal authority
      would have kept the camp in a perpetual uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crossing of Henderson River,&mdash;a stream about fifty yards wide,
      and eight or ten feet deep, with very precipitous banks,&mdash;they were
      compelled to make a bridge or causeway with timbers cut by the troops, and
      a filling-in of bushes, earth, or any other available material. This was
      the work of a day and night. Upon its completion, the horses and oxen were
      taken from the wagons, and the latter taken over by hand. But, when the
      horses came to cross, many of them were killed in sliding down the steep
      banks. "While in camp here," says a private in Capt. Lincoln's company, "a
      general order was issued prohibiting the discharge of fire-arms within
      fifty steps of the camp. Capt. Lincoln disobeyed the order by firing his
      pistol within ten steps of the camp, and for this violation of orders was
      put under arrest for that day, and his sword taken from him; but the next
      day his sword was restored, and nothing more was done in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      From Henderson River the troops marched to Yellow Banks, on the
      Mississippi. "While at this place," Mr. Ben F. Irwin says, "a considerable
      body of Indians of the Cherokee tribe came across the river from the Iowa
      side, with the white flag hoisted. These were the first Indians we saw.
      They were very friendly, and gave us a general war-dance. We, in return,
      gave them a Sucker ho-down. All enjoyed the sport, and it is safe to say
      no man enjoyed it more than Capt. Lincoln."
    </p>
    <p>
      From Yellow Banks, a rapid and exhaustive march of a few days brought the
      volunteers to the mouth of Rock River, where "it was agreed between Gen.
      Whiteside and Gen. Atkinson of the regulars, that the volunteers should
      march up Rock River, about fifty miles, to the Prophet's Town, and there
      encamp, to feed and rest their horses, and await the arrival of the
      regular troops, in keel-boats, with provisions. Judge William Thomas, who
      again acted as quartermaster to the volunteers, made an estimate of the
      amount of provisions required until the boats could arrive, which was
      supplied; and then Gen. Whiteside took up his line of march." 1 But Capt.
      Lincoln's company did not march on the present occasion with the alacrity
      which distinguished their comrades of other corps. The orderly sergeant
      attempted to "form company," but the company declined to be formed; the
      men, oblivious of wars and rumors of wars, mocked at the word of command,
      and remained between their blankets in a state of serene repose. For an
      explanation of these signs of passive mutiny, we must resort again to the
      manuscript of the private who gave the story of Capt. Lincoln's first
      arrest. "About the&mdash;of April, we reached the mouth of Rock River.
      About three or four nights afterwards, a man named Rial P. Green, commonly
      called 'Pot Green,' belonging to a Green-county company, came to oar
      company, and waked up the men, and proposed to them, that, if they would
      furnish him with a tomahawk and four buckets, he would get into the
      officers' liquors, and supply the men with wines and brandies. The desired
      articles were furnished him; and, with the assistance of one of our
      company, he procured the liquors. All this was entirely unknown to Capt.
      Lincoln. In the morning. Capt. Lincoln ordered his orderly to form company
      for parade; but when the orderly called the men to 'parade,' they called
      'parade,' too, but couldn't fall into line. The most of the men were
      unmistakably drunk. The rest of the forces marched off, and left Capt.
      Lincoln's company behind. The company didn't make a start until about ten
      o'clock, and then, after marching about two miles, the drunken ones lay
      down and slept their drunk off. They overtook the forces that night. Capt.
      Lincoln was again put under arrest, and was obliged to carry a wooden
      sword for two days, and this although Capt. Lincoln was entirely blameless
      in the matter."

      When Gen. Whiteside reached Prophetstown, where he was to rest until the
      arrival of the regulars and the supplies, he disregarded the plan of
      operations concerted between him and Atkinson, and, burning the village to
      the ground, pushed on towards Dixon's Ferry, forty miles farther up the
      river. Nearing that place, he left his baggage-wagons behind: the men
      threw away their allotments of provisions, or left them with the wagons;
      and in that condition a forced march was made to Dixon. There Whiteside
      found two battalions of mounted men under Majors Stillman and Bailey, who
      clamored to be thrown forward, where they might get up an independent but
      glorious "brush" with the enemy on comparatively private account. The
      general had it not in his heart to deny these adventurous spirits, and
      they were promptly advanced to feel and disclose the Indian force supposed
      to be near at hand. Stillman accordingly moved up the bank of "Old Man's
      Creek" (since called "Stillman's Run"), to a point about twenty miles from
      Dixon, where, just before nightfall, he went into camp, or was about to do
      so, when several Indians were seen hovering along some raised ground
      nearly a mile distant. Straightway Stillman's gallant fellows remounted,
      one by one, or two and two, and, without officers or orders, galloped away
      in pursuit. The Indians first shook a red flag, and then dashed off at the
      top of their speed. Three of them were overtaken and killed: but the rest
      performed with perfect skill the errand upon which they were sent; they
      led Stillman's command into an ambuscade, where lay Black Hawk himself
      with seven hundred of his warriors. The pursuers recoiled, and rode for
      their lives: Black Hawk bore down upon Stillman's camp; the fugitives,
      streaming back with fearful cries respecting the numbers and ferocity of
      the enemy, spread consternation through the entire force. Stillman gave a
      hasty order to fall back; and the men fell back much faster and farther
      than he intended, for they never faced about, or so much as stopped, until
      they reached Whiteside's camp at Dixon. The first of them reached Dixon
      about twelve o'clock; and others came straggling in all night long and
      part of the next day, each party announcing themselves as the sole
      survivors of that stricken field, escaped solely by the exercise of
      miraculous valor.1

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 "It is said that a big, tall Kentuckian, with a very loud voice, who
        was a colonel of the militia, but a private with Stillman, upon his
        arrival in camp, gave to Gen. Whiteside and the wondering multitude the
        following glowing and bombastic account of the battle. 'Sirs,' said he,
        'our detachment was encamped amongst some scattering timber on the north
        side of Old Man's Creek, with the prairie from the north gently sloping
        down to our encampment. It was just after twilight, in the gloaming of
        the evening, when we discovered Black Hawk's army coming down upon us in
        solid column: they displayed in the form of a crescent upon the brow of
        the prairie, and such accuracy and precision of military movements were
        never witnessed by man; they were equal to the best troops of Wellington
        in Spain. I have said that the Indians came down in solid column, and
        displayed in the form of a crescent; and, what was most wonderful, there
        were large squares of cavalry resting upon the points of the curve,
        which squares were supported again by other columns fifteen deep,
        extending back through the woods, and over a swamp three-quarters of a
        mile, which again rested upon the main body of Black Hawk's army
        bivouacked upon the banks of the Kishwakee. It was a terrible and a
        glorious sight to see the tawny warriors as they rode along our flanks
        attempting to outflank us with the glittering moonbeams glistening from
        their polished blades and burnished spears. It was a sight well
        calculated to strike consternation into the stoutest and boldest heart;
        and accordingly our men soon began to break in small squads for tall
        timber. In a very little time the rout became general. The Indians were
        on our flanks, and threatened the destruction of the entire detachment.
        About this time Major Stillman, Col. Stephenson, Major Perkins, Capt.
        Adams, Mr. Hackelton, and myself, with some others, threw ourselves into
        the rear to rally the fugitives and protect the retreat. But in A short
        time all my companions fell, bravely fighting hand to hand with the
        savage enemy, and I alone was left upon the field of battle. About this
        time I discovered not far to the left, a corps of horsemen which seemed
        to be in tolerable order. I immediately deployed to the left, when,
        leaning down and placing my body in a recumbent posture upon the mane of
        my horse, so as to bring the heads of the horsemen between my eye and
        the horizon, I discovered by the light of the moon that they were
        gentlemen who did not wear hats, by which token I knew they were no
        friends of mine. I therefore made a retrograde movement, and recovered
        my former position, where I remained some time, meditating what further
        I could do in the service of my country, when a random ball came
        whistling by my ear, and plainly whispered to me, "Stranger, you have no
        further business here." Upon hearing this, I followed the example of my
        companions in arms, and broke for tall timber, and the way I run was not
        a little, and quit.' "This colonel was a lawyer just returning from the
        circuit, with a slight wardrobe and 'Chitty's Pleadings' packed in his
        saddle-bags, all of which were captured by the Indians. He afterwards
        related, with much vexation, that Black Hawk had decked himself out in
        his finery, appearing in the woods amongst his savage companions dressed
        in one of the colonel's ruffled shirts drawn over his deer-skin
        leggings, with a volume of 'Chitty's Pleadings' under each arm."&mdash;

      The affair is known to history as "Stillman's Defeat." "Old John Hanks"
      was in it, and speaks of it with shame and indignation, attributing the
      disaster to "drunken men, cowardice, and folly," though in this case we
      should be slow to adopt his opinion. Of folly, there was, no doubt,
      enough, both on the part of Whiteside and Stillman; but of drunkenness no
      public account makes any mention, and individual cowardice is never to be
      imputed to American troops. These men were as brave as any that ever wore
      a uniform, and some of them performed good service afterwards; but when
      they went into this action, they were "raw militia,"&mdash;a mere mob; and
      no mob can stand against discipline, even though it be but the discipline
      of the savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Whiteside moved with all possible celerity to the field of
      Stillman's disaster, and, finding no enemy, was forced to content himself
      with the melancholy duty of burying the mutilated and unsightly remains of
      the dead. All of them were scalped; some had their heads cut off, others
      had their throats cut, and others still were mangled and dishonored in
      ways too shocking to be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army was now suffering for want of provisions. The folly of the
      commander in casting off his baggage-train for the forced march on Dixon,
      the extravagance and improvidence of the men with their scanty rations,
      had exhausted the resources of the quartermasters, and, "except in the
      messes of the most careful and experienced," the camp was nearly destitute
      of food. "The majority had been living on parched corn and coffee for two
      or three days;" but, on the morning of the last march from Dixon,
      Quartermaster Thomas had succeeded in getting a little fresh beef from the
      only white inhabitant of that country, and this the men were glad to eat
      without bread. "I can truly say I was often hungry," said Capt. Lincoln,
      reviewing the events of this campaign. He was, doubtless, as destitute and
      wretched as the rest, but he was patient, quiet, and resolute. Hunger
      brought with it a discontented and mutinous spirit. The men complained
      bitterly of all they had been made to endure, and clamored loudly for a
      general discharge. But Capt. Lincoln kept the "even tenor of his way;"
      and, when his regiment was disbanded, immediately enlisted as a private
      soldier in another company.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the battle-field Whiteside returned to his old camp at Dixon, but
      determined, before doing so, to make one more attempt to retrieve his
      ill-fortune. Black Hawk's pirogues were supposed to be lying a few miles
      distant, in a bend of the Rock River; and the capture of these would serve
      as some relief to the dreary series of errors and miscarriages which had
      hitherto marked the campaign. But Black Hawk had just been teaching him
      strategy in the most effective mode, and the present movement was
      undertaken with an excess of caution almost as ludicrous as Stillman's
      bravado. "To provide as well as might be against danger, one man was
      started at a time in the direction of the point. When he would get a
      certain distance, keeping in sight, a second would start, and so on, until
      a string of men extending five miles from the main army was made, each to
      look out for Indians, and give the sign to right, left, or front, by
      hanging a hat on a bayonet,&mdash;erect for the front, and right or left,
      as the case might be. To raise men to go ahead was with difficulty done,
      and some tried hard to drop back; but we got through safe, and found the
      place deserted, leaving plenty of Indian signs,&mdash;a dead dog and
      several scalps taken in Stillman's defeat, as we supposed them to have
      been taken." After this, the last of Gen. Whiteside's futile attempts, he
      returned to the battle-field, and thence to Dixon, where he was joined by
      Atkinson with the regulars and the long-coveted and much-needed supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, during these many marches and countermarches, an old Indian found
      his way into the camp, weary, hungry, and helpless. He professed to be a
      friend of the whites; and, although it was an exceedingly perilous
      experiment for one of his color, he ventured to throw himself upon the
      mercy of the soldiers. But the men first murmured, and then broke out into
      fierce cries for his blood. "We have come out to fight the Indians," said
      they, "and by God we intend to do it!" The poor Indian, now, in the
      extremity of his distress and peril, did what he ought to have done
      before: he threw down before his assailants a soiled and crumpled paper,
      which he implored them to read before his life was taken. It was a letter
      of character and safe-conduct from Gen. Cass, pronouncing him a faithful
      man, who had done good service in the cause for which this army was
      enlisted. But it was too late: the men refused to read it, or thought it a
      forgery, and were rushing with fury upon the defenceless old savage, when
      Capt. Lincoln bounded between them and their appointed victim. "Men," said
      he, and his voice for a moment stilled the agitation around him, "<i>this
      must not be done: he must not be shot and killed by us.</i>"&mdash;"But,"
      said some of them, "the Indian is a damned spy." Lincoln knew that his own
      life was now in only less danger than that of the poor creature that
      crouched behind him. During the whole of this scene Capt. Lincoln seemed
      to "rise to an unusual height" of stature. The towering form, the passion
      and resolution in his face, the physical power and terrible will exhibited
      in every motion of his body, every gesture of his arm, produced an effect
      upon the furious mob as unexpected perhaps to him as to any one else. They
      paused, listened, fell back, and then sullenly obeyed what seemed to be
      the voice of reason, as well as authority. But there were still some
      murmurs of disappointed rage, and half-suppressed exclamations, which
      looked towards vengeance of some kind. At length one of the men, a little
      bolder than the rest, but evidently feeling that he spoke for the whole,
      cried out, "This is cowardly on your part, Lincoln!" Whereupon the tall
      captain's figure stretched a few inches higher again. He looked down upon
      these varlets who would have murdered a defenceless old Indian, and now
      quailed before his single hand, with lofty contempt. The oldest of his
      acquaintances, even Bill Green, who saw him grapple Jack Armstrong and
      defy the bullies at his back, never saw him so much "aroused" before. "If
      any man thinks I am a coward, let him test it," said he. "Lincoln,"
      responded a new voice, "you are larger and heavier than we are."&mdash;"This
      you can guard against: choose your weapons," returned the rigid captain.
      Whatever may be said of Mr. Lincoln's choice of means for the preservation
      of military discipline, it was certainly very effectual in this case.
      There was no more disaffection in his camp, and the word "coward" was
      never coupled with his name again. Mr. Lincoln understood his men better
      than those who would be disposed to criticise his conduct. He has often
      declared himself, that his life and character were both at stake, and
      would probably have been lost, had he not at that supremely critical
      moment forgotten the officer and asserted the man. To have ordered the
      offenders under arrest would have created a formidable mutiny; to have
      tried and punished them would have been impossible. They could scarcely be
      called soldiers: they were merely armed citizens, with a nominal military
      organization. They were but recently enlisted, and their term of service
      was just about to expire. Had he preferred charges against them, and
      offered to submit their differences to a court of any sort, it would have
      been regarded as an act of personal pusillanimity, and his efficiency
      would have been gone forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was believed to be the strongest man in his regiment, and no doubt
      was. He was certainly the best wrestler in it, and after they left
      Beardstown nobody ever disputed the fact. He is said to have "done the
      wrestling for the company;" and one man insists that he <i>always</i> had
      a handkerchief tied around his person, in readiness for the sport. For a
      while it was firmly believed that no man in the <i>army</i> could throw
      him down. His company confidently pitted him "against the field," and were
      willing to bet all they had on the result. At length, one Mr. Thompson
      came forward and accepted the challenge. He was, in fact, the most famous
      wrestler in the Western country. It is not certain that the report of his
      achievements had ever reached the ears of Mr. Lincoln or his friends; but
      at any rate they eagerly made a match with him as a champion not unworthy
      of their own. Thompson's power and skill, however, were as well known to
      certain persons in the army as Mr. Lincoln's were to others. Each side was
      absolutely certain of the victory, and bet according to their faith.
      Lincoln's company and their sympathizers put up all their portable
      property, and some perhaps not their own, including "knives, blankets,
      tomahawks," and all the most necessary articles of a soldier's outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the men first met, Lincoln was convinced that he could throw
      Thompson; but, after tussling with him a brief space in presence of the
      anxious assemblage, he turned to his friends and said, "This is the most
      powerful man I ever had hold of. He will throw me, and you will lose your
      all, unless I act on the defensive." He managed, nevertheless, "to hold
      him off for some time;" but at last Thompson got the "crotch hoist" on
      him, and, although Lincoln attempted with all his wonderful strength to
      break the hold by "sliding" away, a few moments decided his fate: he was
      fairly thrown. As it required two out of three falls to decide the bets,
      Thompson and he immediately came together again, and with very nearly the
      same result. Lincoln fell under, but the other man fell too. There was
      just enough of uncertainty about it to furnish a pretext for a hot dispute
      and a general fight. Accordingly, Lincoln's men instantly began the proper
      preliminaries to a fracas. "We were taken by surprise," says Mr. Green,
      "and, being unwilling to give up our property and lose our bets, got up an
      excuse as to the result. We declared the fall a kind of dog-fall; did so
      apparently angrily." The fight was coming on apace, and bade fair to be a
      big and bloody one, when Lincoln rose up and said, "Boys, the man actually
      threw me once fair, broadly so; and the second time, this very fall, he
      threw me fairly, though not so apparently so." He would countenance no
      disturbance, and his unexpected and somewhat astonishing magnanimity ended
      all attempts to raise one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln's good friend, Mr. Green, the principal, though not the sole
      authority for the present account of his adventure in behalf of the Indian
      and his wrestle with Thompson, mentions one important incident which is
      found in no other manuscript, and which gives us a glimpse of Mr. Lincoln
      in a scene of another sort. "One other word in reference to Mr. Lincoln's
      care for the health, welfare, and justice to his men. Some officers of the
      United States had claimed that the regular army had a preference in the
      rations and pay. Mr. Lincoln was ordered to do some act which he deemed
      unauthorized. He, however, obeyed, but went to the officer and said to
      him, 'Sir, you forget that we are not under the rules and regulations of
      the War Department at Washington; are only volunteers under the orders and
      regulations of Illinois. Keep in your own sphere, and there will be no
      difficulty; but resistance will hereafter be made to your unjust orders:
      and, further, my men must be equal in all particulars, in rations, arms,
      camps, &amp;c., to the regular army. The man saw that Mr. Lincoln was
      right, and determined to have justice done. Always after this we were
      treated equally well, and just as the regular army was, in every
      particular. This brave, just, and humane act in behalf of the volunteers
      at once attached officers and rank to him, as with hooks of steel."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the army reached Dixon, the almost universal discontent of the men
      had grown so manifest and so ominous, that it could no longer be safely
      disregarded. They longed "for the flesh-pots of Egypt," and fiercely
      demanded their discharge. Although their time had not expired, it was
      determined to march them by way of Paw-Paw Grove to Ottawa, and there
      concede what the governor feared he had no power to withhold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While on our march from Dixon to Fox River," says Mr. Irwin, "one night
      while in camp, which was formed in a square enclosing about forty acres,
      our horses, outside grazing, got scared about nine o'clock; and a grand
      stampede took place. They ran right through our lines in spite of us, and
      ran over many of us. No man knows what noise a thousand horses make
      running, unless he had been there: it beats a young earthquake, especially
      among scared men, and certain they were scared then. We expected the
      Indians to be on us that night. Fire was thrown, drums beat, fifes played,
      which added additional fright to the horses. We saw no real enemy that
      night, but a line of battle was formed. There were no eyes for sleep that
      night: we stood to our posts in line; and what frightened the horses is
      yet unknown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "During this short Indian campaign," continues the same gentleman, "we had
      some hard times,&mdash;often hungry; but we had a great deal of sport,
      especially of nights,&mdash;-foot-racing, some horse-racing, jumping,
      telling anecdotes, in which Lincoln beat all, keeping up a constant
      laughter and good-humor all the time; among the soldiers some
      card-playing, and wrestling, in which Lincoln took a prominent part. I
      think it safe to say he was never thrown in a wrestle. [Mr. Irwin, it
      seems, still regards the Thompson affair as "a dog-fall."] While in the
      army, he kept a handkerchief tied around him near all the time for
      wrestling purposes, and loved the sport as well as any one could. He was
      seldom ever beat jumping. During the campaign, Lincoln himself was always
      ready for an emergency. He endured hardships like a good soldier: he never
      complained, nor did he fear danger. When fighting was expected, or danger
      apprehended, Lincoln was the first to say, 'Let's go.' He had the
      confidence of every man of his company, and they strictly obeyed his
      orders at a word. His company was all young men, and full of sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One night in Warren County, a white hog&mdash;a young sow&mdash;came into
      our lines, which showed more good sense, to my mind, than any hog I ever
      saw. This hog swam creeks and rivers, and went with us clear through to, I
      think, the mouth of Fox River; and there the boys killed it, or it would
      doubtless have come home with us. If it got behind in daylight as we were
      marching, which it did sometimes, it would follow on the track, and come
      to us at night. It was naturally the cleverest, friendly-disposed hog any
      man ever saw, and its untimely death was by many of us greatly deplored,
      for we all liked the hog for its friendly disposition and good manners;
      for it never molested any thing, and kept in its proper place."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th of May the volunteers were discharged. The governor had
      already called for two thousand more men to take their places; but, in the
      mean time, he made the most strenuous efforts to organize a small force
      out of the recently discharged, to protect the frontiers until the new
      levies were ready for service. He succeeded in raising one regiment and a
      spy company. Many officers of distinction, among them Gen. Whiteside
      himself, enlisted as private soldiers, and served in that capacity to the
      end of the war. Capt. Lincoln became Private Lincoln of the "Independent
      Spy Company," Capt. Early commanding; and, although he was never in an
      engagement, he saw some hard service in scouting and trailing, as well as
      in carrying messages and reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of June the new troops were ready for the field, and soon
      after moved up to Rock River. Meanwhile the Indians had overrun the
      country. "They had scattered their war-parties all over the North from
      Chicago to Galena, and from the Illinois River into the Territory of
      Wisconsin; they occupied every grove, waylaid every road, hung around
      every settlement, and attacked every party of white men that attempted to
      penetrate the country." There had been some desultory fighting at various
      points. Capt. Snyder, in whose company Gen. Whiteside was a private, had
      met the Indians at Burr Oak. Grove, and had a sharp engagement; Mr. St.
      Vrain, an Indian agent, with a small party of assistants, had been
      treacherously murdered near Fort Armstrong; several men had been killed at
      the lead mines, and the Wisconsin volunteers under Dodge had signally
      punished the Indians that killed them; Galena had been threatened and Fort
      Apple, twelve miles from Galena, had sustained a bloody siege of fifteen
      hours; Capt. Stephenson of Galena had performed an act which "equalled any
      thing in modern warfare in daring and desperate courage," by driving a
      party of Indians larger than his own detachment into a dense thicket, and
      there charging them repeatedly until he was compelled to retire, wounded
      himself, and leaving three of his men dead on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward the tide was fairly turned against Black Hawk. Twenty-four
      hundred men, under experienced officers, were now in the field against
      him; and, although he succeeded in eluding his pursuers for a brief time,
      every retreat was equivalent to a reverse in battle, and all his
      manoeuvres were retreats. In the latter part of July he was finally
      overtaken by the volunteers under Henry, along the bluffs of the Wisconsin
      River, and defeated in a decisive battle. His ruin was complete: he
      abandoned all hope of conquest, and pressed in disorderly and disastrous
      retreat toward the Mississippi, in vain expectation of placing that
      barrier between him and his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day, after crossing the Wisconsin, Gen. Atkinson's advance
      reached the high grounds near the Mississippi. Henry and his brigade,
      having won the previous victory, were placed at the rear in the order of
      march, with the ungenerous purpose of preventing them from winning
      another. But Black Hawk here resorted to a stratagem which very nearly
      saved the remnant of his people, and in the end completely foiled the
      intentions of Atkinson regarding Henry and his men. The old chief, with
      the high heart which even such a succession of reverses could not subdue,
      took twenty warriors and deliberately posted himself, determined to hold
      the army in check or lead it away on a false trail, while his main body
      was being transferred to the other bank of the river. He accordingly made
      his attack in a place where he was favored by trees, logs, and tall grass,
      which prevented the discovery of his numbers. Finding his advance engaged,
      Atkinson formed a line of battle, and ordered a charge; but Black Hawk
      conducted his retreat with such consummate skill that Atkinson believed he
      was just at the heels of the whole Indian army, and under this impression
      continued the pursuit far up the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry came up to the spot where the fight had taken place, he readily
      detected the trick by various evidences about the ground. Finding the main
      trail in the immediate vicinity, he boldly fell upon it without orders,
      and followed it until he came up with the Indians in a swamp on the margin
      of the river, where he easily surprised and scattered them. Atkinson,
      hearing the firing in the swamp, turned back, and arrived just in time to
      assist in the completion of the massacre. A few of the Indians had already
      crossed the river: a few had taken refuge on a little willow island in the
      middle of the stream. The island was charged,&mdash;the men wading to it
      in water up to their arm-pits,&mdash;the Indians were dislodged and killed
      on the spot, or shot in the water while attempting to swim to the western
      shore. Fifty prisoners only were taken, and the greater part of these were
      squaws and children. This was the battle of the Bad Axe,&mdash;a terrific
      slaughter, considering the numbers engaged, and the final ruin of Black
      Hawk's fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Hawk and his twenty warriors, among whom was his own son, made the
      best of their way to the Dalles on the Wisconsin, where they seem to have
      awaited passively whatever fate their enemies should contrive for them.
      There were some Sioux and Winnebagoes in Atkinson's camp,&mdash;men who
      secretly pretended to sympathize with Black Hawk, and, while acting as
      guides to the army, had really led it astray on many painful and perilous
      marches. It is certain that Black Hawk had counted on the assistance of
      those tribes; but after the fight on the Wisconsin, even those who had
      consented to act as his emissaries about the person of the hostile
      commander not only deserted him, but volunteered to hunt him down. They
      now offered to find him, take him, and bring him in, provided that base
      and cowardly service should be suitably acknowledged. They were duly
      employed. Black Hawk became their prisoner, and was presented by them to
      the Indian agent with two or three shameless and disgusting speeches from
      his captors. He and his son were carried to Washington City, and then
      through the principal cities of the country, after which President Jackson
      released him from captivity, and sent him back to his own people. He lived
      to be eighty years old, honored and beloved by his tribe, and after his
      death was buried on an eminence overlooking the Mississippi, with such
      rites as are accorded only to the most distinguished of native captains,&mdash;sitting
      upright in war dress and paint, covered by a conspicuous mound of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have given a rapid and perhaps an unsatisfactory sketch of the
      comparatively great events which brought the Black Hawk War to a close. So
      much at least was necessary, that the reader might understand the several
      situations in which Mr. Lincoln found himself during the short term of his
      second enlistment. We fortunately possess a narrative of his individual
      experience, covering the whole of that period, from the pen of George W.
      Harrison, his friend, companion, and messmate. It is given in full; for
      there is no part of it that would not be injured by the touch of another
      hand. It is an extremely interesting story, founded upon accurate personal
      knowledge, and told in a perspicuous and graphic style, admirably suited
      to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The new company thus formed was called the 'Independent Spy Company;' not
      being under the control of any regiment or brigade, but receiving orders
      directly from the commander-in-chief, and always, when with the army,
      camping within the lines, and having many other privileges, such as never
      having camp-duties to perform, drawing rations as much and as often as we
      pleased, &amp;c, Dr. Early (deceased) of Springfield was elected captain.
      Five members constituted a tent, or 'messed' together. Qur mess consisted
      of Mr. Lincoln, Johnston (a half-brother of his), Fanchier, Wyatt, and
      myself. The 'Independent Spy Company' was used chiefly to carry messages,
      to send an express, to spy the enemy, and to ascertain facts. I suppose
      the nearest we were to doing battle was at Gratiot's Grove, near Galena.
      The spy company of Posey's brigade was many miles in advance of the
      brigade, when it stopped in the grove at noon for refreshments. Some of
      the men had turned loose their horses, and others still had theirs in
      hand, when five or six Sac and Fox Indians came near them. Many of the
      white men broke after them, some on horseback, some on foot, in great
      disorder and confusion, thinking to have much sport with their prisoners
      immediately. The Indians thus decoyed them about two miles from the little
      cabins in the grove, keeping just out of danger, when suddenly up sprang
      from the tall prairie grass two hundred and fifty painted warriors, with
      long spears in hand, and tomahawks and butcher-knives in their belts of
      deer-skin and buffalo, and raised such a yell that our friends supposed
      them to be more numerous than Black Hawk's whole clan, and, instantly
      filled with consternation, commenced to retreat. But the savages soon
      began to spear them, making it necessary to halt in the flight, and give
      them a fire, at which time they killed two Indians, one of them being a
      young chief gayly apparelled. Again, in the utmost horror, such as savage
      yells alone can produce, they fled for the little fort in the grove.
      Having arrived, they found the balance of their company, terrified by the
      screams of the whites and the yells of the savages, closely shut up in the
      double cabin, into which <i>they</i> quickly plunged, and found the
      much-needed respite. The Indians then prowled around the grove, shooting
      nearly all the company's horses, and stealing the balance of them. There,
      from cracks between the logs of the cabin, three Indians were shot and
      killed in the act of reaching for the reins of bridles on horses. They
      endeavored to conceal their bodies by trees in an old field which
      surrounded the fort; but, reaching with sticks for bridles, they exposed
      their heads and necks, and all of them were shot with two balls each
      through the neck. These three, and the two killed where our men wheeled
      and fired, make five Indians known to be killed; and on their retreat from
      the prairie to the grove, five white men were cut into small pieces. The
      field of this action is the greatest battle-ground we saw. The dead still
      lay unburied until after we arrived at sunrise the next day. The forted
      men, fifty strong, had not ventured to go out until they saw us, when they
      rejoiced greatly that friends and not dreaded enemies had come. They
      looked like men just out of cholera,&mdash;having passed through the
      cramping stage. The only part we could then act was to seek the lost men,
      and with hatchets and hands to bury them. We buried the white men, and
      trailed the dead young chief where he had been drawn on the grass a
      half-mile, and concealed in the thicket. Those who trailed this once noble
      warrior, and found him, were Lincoln, I think, Wyatt, and myself. By order
      of Gen. Atkinson, our company started on this expedition one evening,
      travelled all night, and reached Gratiot's at sunrise. A few hours after,
      Gen. Posey came up to the fort with his brigade of nearly a thousand men,
      when he positively refused to pursue the Indians,&mdash;being strongly
      solicited by Capt. Early, Lincoln, and others,&mdash;squads of Indians
      still showing themselves in a menacing manner one and a half miles
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our company was disbanded at Whitewater, Wis., a short time before the
      massacre at Bad Axe by Gen. Henry; and most of our men started for home on
      the following morning; but it so happened that the night previous to
      starting on this long trip, Lincoln's horse and mine were stolen, probably
      by soldiers of our own army, and we were thus compelled to start outside
      the cavalcade; but I laughed at our fate, and he joked at it, and we all
      started off merrily. But the generous men of our company walked and rode
      by turns with us; and we fared about equal with the rest. But for this
      generosity, our legs would have had to do the better work; for in that
      day, this then dreary route furnished no horses to buy or to steal; and,
      whether on horse or afoot, we always had company, for many of the horses'
      backs were too sore for riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus we came to Peoria: here we bought a canoe, in which we two paddled
      our way to Pekin. The other members of our company, separating in various
      directions, stimulated by the proximity of home, could never have
      consented to travel at our usual tardy mode. At Pekin, Lincoln made an oar
      with which to row our little boat, while I went through the town in order
      to buy provisions for the trip. One of us pulled away at the one oar,
      while the other sat astern to steer, or prevent circling. The river being
      very low was without current, so that we had to pull hard to make half the
      speed of legs on land,&mdash;in fact, we let her float all night, and on
      the next morning always found the objects still visible that were beside
      us the previous evening. The water was remarkably clear, for this river of
      plants, and the fish appeared to be sporting with us as we moved over or
      near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the next day after we left Pekin, we overhauled a raft of saw-logs,
      with two men afloat on it to urge it on with poles and to guide it in the
      channel. We immediately pulled up to them and went on the raft, where we
      were made welcome by various demonstrations, especially by that of an
      invitation to a feast on fish, corn-bread, eggs, butter, and coffee, just
      prepared for our benefit. Of these good things we ate almost immoderately,
      for it was the only warm meal we had made for several days. While
      preparing it, and after dinner, Lincoln entertained them, and they
      entertained us for a couple of hours very amusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This slow mode of travel was, at the time, a new mode, and the novelty
      made it for a short time agreeable. We descended the Illinois to Havana,
      where we sold our boat, and again set out the old way, over the
      sand-ridges for Petersburg. As we drew near home, the impulse became
      stronger, and urged us on amazingly. The long strides of Lincoln, often
      slipping back in the loose sand six inches every step, were just right for
      me; and he was greatly diverted when he noticed me behind him stepping
      along in his tracks to keep from slipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About three days after leaving the army at Whitewater, we saw a battle in
      full operation about two miles in advance of us. Lincoln was riding a
      young horse, the property of L. D. Matheny. I was riding a sprightly
      animal belonging to John T. Stuart. At the time we came in sight of the
      scene, our two voluntary footmen were about three-fourths of a mile in
      advance of us, and we about half a mile behind most of our company, and
      three or four on foot still behind us, leading some sore-backed horses.
      But the owners of our horses came running back, and, meeting us all in
      full speed, rightfully ordered us to dismount. We obeyed: they mounted,
      and all pressed on toward the conflict,&mdash;they on horseback, we on
      foot. In a few moments of hard walking and terribly close observation,
      Lincoln said to me, 'George, this can't be a very dangerous battle.'
      Reply: 'Much shooting, nothing falls.' It was at once decided to be a sham
      for the purpose of training cavalry, instead of Indians having attacked a
      few white soldiers, and a few of our own men, on their way home, for the
      purpose of killing them."

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE volunteers from Sangamon returned to their homes shortly before the
      State election, at which, among other officers, assembly-men were to be
      chosen. Lincoln's popularity had been greatly enhanced by his service in
      the war, and some of his friends urged him with warm solicitations to
      become a candidate at the coming election. He prudently resisted, and
      declined to consent, alleging in excuse his limited acquaintance in the
      county at large, until Mr. James Rutledge, the founder of New Salem, added
      the weight of his advice to the nearly unanimous desire of the
      neighborhood. It is quite likely that his recent military career was
      thought to furnish high promise of usefulness in civil affairs; but Mr.
      Rutledge was sure that he saw another proof of his great abilities in a
      speech which Abe was induced to make, just about this time, before the
      New-Salem Literary Society. The following is an account of this speech by
      R. B. Rutledge, the son of James:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the year 1832 or 1833, Mr. Lincoln made his first effort at public
      speaking. A debating club, of which James Rutledge was president, was
      organized, and held regular meetings. As he arose to speak, his tall form
      towered above the little assembly. Both hands were thrust down deep in the
      pockets of his pantaloons. A perceptible smile at once lit up the faces of
      the audience, for all anticipated the relation of some humorous story. But
      he opened up the discussion in splendid style, to the infinite
      astonishment of his friends. As he warmed with his subject, his hands
      would forsake his pockets and would enforce his ideas by awkward gestures,
      but would very soon seek their easy resting-places. He pursued the
      question with reason and argument so pithy and forcible that all were
      amazed. The president at his fireside, after the meeting, remarked to his
      wife, that there was more in Abe's head than wit and fun; that he was
      already a fine speaker; that all he lacked was culture to enable him to
      reach the high destiny which he knew was in store for him. From that time
      Mr. Rutledge took a deeper interest in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon after Mr. Rutledge urged him to announce himself as a candidate for
      the Legislature. This he at first declined to do, averring that it was
      impossible to be elected. It was suggested that a canvass of the county
      would bring him prominently before the people, and in time would do him
      good. He reluctantly yielded to the solicitations of his friends, and made
      a partial canvass."
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days political animosities were fierce enough; but, owing to the
      absence of nominating conventions, party lines were not, as yet, very
      distinctly drawn in Illinois. Candidates announced themselves; but,
      usually, it was done after full consultation with influential friends, or
      persons of considerable power in the neighborhood of the candidate's
      residence. We have already seen the process by which Mr. Lincoln was
      induced to come forward. There were often secret combinations among a
      number of candidates, securing a mutual support; but in the present case
      there is no trace of such an understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This (1832) was the year of Gen. Jackson's election. The Democrats
      stigmatized their opponents as "Federalists," while the latter were
      steadily struggling to shuffle off the odious name. For the present they
      called themselves Democratic Republicans; and it was not until 1833 or
      1834, that they formally took to themselves the designation of Whig. The
      Democrats were known better as Jackson men than as Democrats, and were
      inexpressibly proud of either name. Four or five years afterward their
      enemies invented for their benefit the meaningless and hideous word
      "Locofoco."
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 1826 every general election in the State had resulted in a
      Democratic victory. The young men were mostly Democrats; and the most
      promising talents in the State were devoted to the cause, which seemed
      destined to achieve success wherever there was a contest. In a new country
      largely peopled by adventurers from older States, there were necessarily
      found great numbers who would attach themselves to the winning side merely
      because it was the winning side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to restate here the prevailing questions in national
      politics,&mdash;Jackson's stupendous struggle with the bank, "hard money,"
      "no monopoly," internal improvements, the tariff, and nullification, or
      the personal and political relations of the chieftains,&mdash;Jackson,
      Clay, and Calhoun. Mr. Lincoln will shortly disclose in one of his
      speeches from the stump which of those questions were of special interest
      to the people of Illinois, and consequently which of them principally
      occupied his own attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats were divided into "whole-hog men" and "nominal Jackson men;"
      the former being thoroughly devoted to the fortunes and principles of
      their leader, while the latter were willing to trim a little for the sake
      of popular support. It is probable that Mr. Lincoln might be fairly
      classed as a "nominal Jackson man," although the precise character of some
      of the views he then held, or is supposed to have held, on national
      questions, is involved in considerable doubt. He had not wholly forgotten
      Jones, or Jones's teachings. He still remembered his high disputes with
      Offutt in the shanty at Spring Creek, when he effectually defended Jackson
      against the "abuse" of his employer. He was not Whig, but "Whiggish," as
      Dennis Hanks expresses it. It is not likely that a man who deferred so
      habitually to the popular sentiment around him would have selected the
      occasion of his settlement in a new place to go over bodily to a hopeless
      political minority. At all events, we have at least three undisputed
      facts, which make it plain that he then occupied an intermediate position
      between the extremes of all parties. First, he received the votes of all
      parties at New Salem; second, he was the next year appointed postmaster by
      Gen. Jackson; and, third, the Democrats ran him for the legislature two
      years afterwards; and he was elected by a larger majority than any other
      candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our old way of conducting elections," says Gov. Ford, "required each
      aspirant to announce himself as a candidate. The most prudent, however,
      always consulted a little caucus of select, influential friends. The
      candidates then travelled around the county, or State, in proper person,
      making speeches, conversing with the people, soliciting votes, whispering
      slanders against their opponents, and defending themselves against the
      attacks of their adversaries; but it was not always best to defend against
      such attacks. A candidate in a fair way to be elected should never deny
      any charge made against him; for, if he does, his adversaries will prove
      all that they have said, and much more. As a candidate did not offer
      himself as the champion of any party, he usually agreed with all opinions,
      and promised every thing demanded by the people, and most usually
      promised, either directly or indirectly, his support to all the other
      candidates at the same election. One of the arts was to raise a quarrel
      with unpopular men who were odious to the people, and then try to be
      elected upon the unpopularity of others, as well as upon his own
      popularity. These modes of electioneering were not true of all the
      candidates, nor perhaps of half of them, very many of them being gentlemen
      of first-class integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      That portion of the people whose influence lay in their fighting
      qualities, and who were prone to carry a huge knife in the belt of the
      hunting-shirt, were sometimes called the "butcher-knife boys," and
      sometimes "the half-horse and half-alligator men." This class, according
      to Gov. Ford, "made a kind of balance-of-power party." Their favorite was
      sure of success; and nearly all political contests were decided by
      "butcher-knife influence." "In all elections and in all enactments of the
      Legislature, great pains were taken by all candidates, and all men in
      office, to make their course and measures acceptable" to these knights of
      steel and muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later date they enjoyed a succession of titles, such as "barefoot
      boys," "the flat-footed boys," and "the big-pawed boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      In those times, Gov. Ford avers that he has seen all the rum-shops and
      groceries of the principal places of a county chartered by candidates, and
      kept open for the gratuitous accommodation of the free and independent
      electors for several weeks before the vote. Every Saturday afternoon the
      people flocked to the county-seat, to see the candidates, to hear
      speeches, to discuss prospects, to get drunk and fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toward evening they would mount their ponies, go reeling from side to
      side, galloping through town, and throwing up their caps and hats,
      screeching like so many infernal spirits broke loose from their nether
      prison; and thus they separated for their homes." These observations occur
      in Ford's account of the campaign of 1830, which resulted in the choice of
      Gov. Reynolds,&mdash;two years before Mr. Lincoln first became a
      candidate,&mdash;and lead us to suppose that the body of electors before
      whom that gentleman presented himself were none too cultivated or refined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln's first appearance on the stump, in the course of the canvass,
      was at Pappsville, about eleven miles west of Springfield, upon the
      occasion of a public sale by the firm of Poog &amp; Knap. The sale over,
      speech-making was about to begin, when Mr. Lincoln observed strong
      symptoms of inattention in his audience, who had taken that particular
      moment to engage in what Mr. James A. Herndon pronounces "a general
      fight." Lincoln saw that one of his friends was suffering more than he
      liked in the <i>mêlée</i>; and, stepping into the crowd, he shouldered
      them sternly away from his man, until he met a fellow who refused to fall
      back: him he seized by the nape of the neck and the seat of his breeches,
      and tossed him "ten or twelve feet easily." After this episode,&mdash;as
      characteristic of him as of the times,&mdash;he mounted the platform, and
      delivered, with awkward modesty, the following speech:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens, I presume you all know who I am. I am
      humble Abraham Lincoln. I have been solicited by many friends to become a
      candidate for the Legislature. My politics are short and sweet, like the
      old woman's dance. I am in favor of a national bank. I am in favor of the
      internal-improvement system and a high protective tariff. These are my
      sentiments and political principles. If elected, I shall be thankful; if
      not, it will be all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      In these few sentences Mr. Lincoln adopted the leading principles of the
      Whig party,&mdash;Clay's "American System" in full. In his view, as we
      shall see by another paper from him when again a candidate in 1834, the
      internal-improvement system required the distribution of the proceeds of
      the sales of the public lands amongst the States. He says nothing of South
      Carolina, of nullification, of disunion; and on these subjects it is quite
      probable his views were like Mr. Webster's, and his sympathies with
      Jackson. The opinions announced in this speech, on all the subjects
      touched by the speaker, were as emphatically Whig as they could be made in
      words; yet as far as they related to internal improvements, and indirectly
      favored the increase of bank issues, they were such as most of the
      "nominal Jackson men" in Illinois professed to hold, and such as they
      united with the Whigs to enforce, then and afterwards, in the State
      Legislature. The "whole-hog men" would have none of them, and therein lay
      the distinction. Although the Democratic party continued to have a
      numerical majority for many years in the Legislature, the nominal men and
      the Whigs coalesced to control legislation in accordance with Whig
      doctrines. Even with such a record made and making by them, the "nominal
      men" persisted in calling themselves Democrats, while Jackson was vetoing
      the Maysville Road Bill, grappling with the National Bank, and exposing
      the oppressive character of the Tariff Act then in force, which imposed
      the highest scale of duties since the first enactment for "protection" in
      1816. It was their practice to run men like themselves for the State
      offices where the chances of a plain-spoken Whig were hopeless; and, by
      means of the "nominal" character of the candidate, secure enough
      Democratic votes, united with the Whigs, to elect him. In the very next
      canvass Mr. Lincoln himself was taken up by such a combination and
      triumphantly elected. Such things were made feasible by the prevalent mode
      of making nominations without the salutary intervention of regular party
      conventions and committees. We repeat that Mr. Lincoln's position was
      midway between the extremes in local politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend, Mr. A. Y. Ellis, who was with him during a part of this
      campaign, says, "He wore a mixed jeans coat, claw-hammer style, short in
      the sleeves, and bobtail,&mdash;in fact, it was so short in the tail he
      could not sit on it,&mdash;flax and tow linen pantaloons, and a straw hat.
      I think he wore a vest, but do not remember how it looked. He then wore
      pot-metal boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accompanied him on one of his electioneering trips to Island Grove; and
      he made a speech which pleased his party friends very well indeed, though
      some of the Jackson men tried to make sport of it. He told several
      anecdotes in his speech, and applied them, as I thought, very well. He
      also told the boys several stories which drew them after him. I remember
      them; but modesty and my veneration for his memory forbid me to relate
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. J. R. Herndon, his friend and landlord, heard him make several
      speeches about this time, and gives us the following extract from one,
      which seems to have made a special impression upon the minds of his
      auditors: "Fellow-citizens, I have been told that some of my opponents
      have said that it was a disgrace to the county of Sangamon to have such a
      looking man as I am stuck up for the Legislature. Now, I thought this was
      a free country: that is the reason I address you today. Had I have known
      to the contrary, I should not have consented to run; but I will say one
      thing, let the shoe pinch where it may: when I have been a candidate
      before you some five or six times, and have been beaten every time, I will
      consider it a disgrace, and will be sure never to try it again; but I am
      bound to beat that man if I am beat myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      These were not the only speeches he made in furtherance of his present
      claims, but they are all of which we have any intelligible account. There
      was one subject upon which he felt himself peculiarly competent to speak,&mdash;the
      practical application of the "internal-improvement system" to the river
      which flowed by the doors of the constituency he addressed. He firmly
      believed in the right of the Legislature of the State or the Congress of
      the United States to appropriate the public money to local improvements
      for the sole advantage of limited districts; and that he believed it good
      policy to exercise the right, his subsequent conduct in the Legislature,
      and an elaborate speech in Congress, are sufficient proof. In this
      doctrine he had the almost unanimous support of the people of Illinois.
      Almost every man in the State was a speculator in town lots or lands. Even
      the farmers had taken up or held the very lands they tilled with a view to
      a speculation in the near future. Long after the Democratic party in the
      South and East, leaving Mr. Calhoun in a state of isolation, had begun to
      inculcate different views of constitutional power and duty, it was a
      dangerous thing for a politician in Illinois to intimate his agreement
      with them. Mr. Lincoln knew well that the policy of local improvement at
      the general expense was at that moment decidedly the most popular platform
      he could mount; but he felt that this was not enough for his individual
      purposes, since it was no invention of his, and belonged to nearly
      everybody else as much as to him. He therefore prudently ingrafted upon it
      a hobby of his own: "The Improvement of the Sangamon River,"&mdash;a plan
      to straighten it by means of cuts, to clear out its obstructions, and make
      it a commercial highway at the cost of the State. That the idea was
      nearly, if not quite impracticable, the trip of "The Talisman" under Mr.
      Lincoln's piloting, and the fact that the river remained unimproved during
      all the years of the "internal-improvement" mania, would seem to be pretty
      clear evidence. But the theme was agreeable to the popular ear, and had
      been dear to Lincoln from the moment he laid his eyes on the Sangamon. It
      was the great topic of his speech against Posey and Ewing in Macon County,
      when, under the auspices of John Hanks, he "beat" those professional
      politicians so completely that they applauded him themselves. His
      experience in navigating the river was not calculated to make him forget
      it, and it had occupied his thoughts more or less from that day forward.
      Now that it might be turned to good use, where he was personally
      interested, he set about preparing a written address on it, and on some
      other questions of local interest, upon which he bestowed infinite pains.
      The "grammatical errors" in the first draft were corrected by Mr. McNamar,
      the pioneer of New Salem as a business point, and the gentleman who was
      destined to be Mr. Lincoln's rival in the most important love-affair of
      his life. He may have consulted the schoolmaster also; but, if he had done
      so, it is hardly to be surmised that the schoolmaster would have left so
      important a fact out of his written reminiscences. It is more probable
      that Mr. Lincoln confined his applications for assistance on this most
      important matter to the quarter where he could get light on politics as
      well as grammar. However that may have been, the following is the finished
      paper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the People of Sangamon County.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fellow-Citizens,&mdash;Having become a candidate for the honorable office
      of one of your Representatives in the next General Assembly of this State,
      in accordance with an established custom and the principles of true
      republicanism, it becomes my duty to make known to you, the people, whom I
      propose to represent, my sentiments with regard to local affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of
      internal improvements. That the poorest and most thinly-populated
      countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and in
      the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no person
      will deny. Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other kind,
      without first knowing that we are able to finish them,&mdash;as
      half-finished work generally proves to be labor lost. There cannot justly
      be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to other
      good things, provided they cost nothing. The only objection is to paying
      for them; and the objection arises from the want of ability to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the County of Sangamon, some more easy means of
      communication than it now possesses, for the purpose of facilitating the
      task of exporting the surplus products of its fertile soil, and importing
      necessary articles from abroad, are indispensably necessary. A meeting has
      been held of the citizens of Jacksonville and the adjacent country, for
      the purpose of deliberating and inquiring into the expediency of
      constructing a railroad from some eligible point on the Illinois River,
      through the town of Jacksonville, in Morgan County, to the town of
      Springfield, in Sangamon County. This is, indeed, a very desirable object.
      No other improvement that reason will justify us in hoping for can equal
      in utility the railroad. It is a never-failing source of communication
      between places of business remotely situated from each other. Upon the
      railroad the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted
      by either high or low water, or freezing weather, which are the principal
      difficulties that render our future hopes of water communication
      precarious and uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our
      country may be; however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of
      it,&mdash;there is always a heart-appalling shock accompanying the account
      of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations.
      The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at $290,000;
      the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is sufficient to justify the
      belief that the improvement of the Sangamon River is an object much better
      suited to our infant resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respecting this view, I think I may say, without the fear of being
      contradicted, that its navigation may be rendered completely practicable
      as high as the mouth of the South Fork, or probably higher, to vessels of
      from twenty-five to thirty tons' burden, for at least one-half of all
      common years, and to vessels of much greater burden a part of the time.
      From my peculiar circumstances, it is probable, that for the last twelve
      months I have given as particular attention to the stage of the water in
      this river as any other person in the country. In the month of March,
      1831, in company with others, I commenced the building of a flatboat on
      the Sangamon, and finished and took her out in the course of the spring.
      Since that time I have been concerned in the mill at New Salem. These
      circumstances are sufficient evidence that I have not been very
      inattentive to the stages of the water. The time at which we crossed the
      mill-dam being in the last days of April, the water was lower than it had
      been since the breaking of winter in February, or than it was for several
      weeks after. The principal difficulties we encountered in descending the
      river were from the drifted timber, which obstructions all know are not
      difficult to be removed. Knowing almost precisely the height of water at
      that time, I believe I am safe in saying that it has as often been higher
      as lower since.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this view of the subject, it appears that my calculations with regard
      to the navigation of the Sangamon cannot but be founded in reason; but,
      whatever may be its natural advantages, certain it is, that it never can
      be practically useful to any great extent, without being greatly improved
      by art. The drifted timber, as I have before mentioned, is the most
      formidable barrier to this object. Of all parts of this river, none will
      require so much labor in proportion to make it navigable, as the last
      thirty or thirty-five miles; and going with the meanderings of the
      channel, when we are this distance above its mouth we are only between
      twelve and eighteen miles above Beardstown, in something near a straight
      direction; and this route is upon such low ground as to retain water in
      many places during the season, and in all parts such as to draw two-thirds
      or three-fourths of the river-water at all high stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This route is on prairie land the whole distance; so that it appears to
      me, by removing the turf a sufficient width, and damming up the old
      channel, the whole river in a short time would wash its way through,
      thereby curtailing the distance, and increasing the velocity of the
      current, very considerably: while there would be no timber on the banks to
      obstruct its navigation in future; and, being nearly straight, the timber
      which might float in at the head would be apt to go clear through. There
      are also many places above this where the river, in its zigzag course,
      forms such complete peninsulas, as to be easier to cut at the necks than
      to remove the obstructions from the bends, which, if done, would also
      lessen the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say. It is probable,
      however, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the
      same length. Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon River to
      be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county; and,
      if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this for its object,
      which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and shall receive my
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that the practice of drawing money at exorbitant rates of
      interest has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose I
      may enter upon it without claiming the honor, or risking the danger, which
      may await its first explorer. It seems as though we are never to have an
      end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as prejudicial to
      the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand
      dollars annually laid on each county, for the benefit of a few individuals
      only, unless there be a law made fixing the limits of usury. A law for
      this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made, without materially injuring
      any class of people. In cases of extreme necessity, there could always be
      means found to cheat the law; while in all other cases it would have its
      intended effect. I would favor the passage of a law on this subject which
      might not be very easily evaded. Let it be such that the labor and
      difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest
      necessity.1

      Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system
      respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject
      which we as a people can be engaged in. That every man may receive at
      least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the histories
      of his own and other countries, by which he may duly appreciate the value
      of our free institutions, appears to be an object of vital importance,
      even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and
      satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the Scriptures and
      other works, both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I desire to see the time when education&mdash;and, by its
      means, morality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry&mdash;shall become
      much more general than at present, and should be gratified to have it in
      my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which
      might have a tendency to accelerate the happy period.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be
      necessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws&mdash;the
      law respecting the issuing of executions, the road-law, and some others&mdash;are
      deficient in their present form, and require alterations. But, considering
      the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than
      myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless they were first
      attacked by others; in which case I should feel it both a privilege and a
      duty to take that stand, which, in my view, might tend most to the
      advancement of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of
      modesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already
      been more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of which I
      have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in regard to
      any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim, that it is better only
      sometimes to be right than at all times wrong, so soon as I discover my
      opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or
      not, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being
      truly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their
      esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be
      developed. I am young, and unknown to many of you. I was born, and have
      ever remained, in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or
      popular relations or friends to recommend. My case is thrown exclusively
      upon the independent voters of the county; and, if elected, they will have
      conferred a favor upon me, for which I shall be unremitting in my labors
      to compensate. But, if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to
      keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with disappointments
      to be very much chagrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Friend and Fellow-Citizen,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. LINCOLN.
    </p>
    <p>
      New Salem, March 9, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was defeated at the election, having four hundred and seventy
      votes less than the candidate who had the highest number. But his
      disappointment was softened by the action of his immediate neighbors, who
      gave him an almost unanimous support. With three solitary exceptions, he
      received the whole vote of his precinct,&mdash;two hundred and
      seventy-seven,&mdash;being one more than the whole number cast for both
      the candidates for Congress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE results of the canvass for the Legislature were precisely such as had
      been predicted, both by Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Rutledge: he had been
      defeated, as he expected himself; and it had done "him much good," in the
      politician's sense, as promised by Mr. Rutledge. He was now somewhat
      acquainted with the people outside of the New Salem district, and
      generally marked as a young man of good parts and popular manners. The
      vote given him at home demonstrated his local strength, and made his favor
      a thing of value to the politicians of all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after his return from the army, he had taken quarters at the house of
      J. R. Herndon, who loved him then, and always, with as much sincerity as
      one man can love another. Mr. Herndon's family likewise "became much
      attached to him." He "nearly always had one" of Herndon's children "around
      with him." Mr. Herndon says of him further, that he was "at home wherever
      he went;" making himself wonderfully agreeable to the people he lived
      with, or whom he happened to be visiting. Among other things, "he was very
      kind to the widow and orphan, and chopped their wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln, as we have seen already, was not enamored of the life of a common
      laborer,&mdash;mere hewing and drawing. He preferred to clerk, to go to
      war, to enter politics,&mdash;any thing but that dreary round of daily
      toil and poor pay. But he was now, as he would say, "in a fix:" clerks
      were not wanted every day in New Salem and he began to cast about for some
      independent business of his own, by which he could earn enough to pay
      board and buy books. In every community where he had lived, "the merchant"
      had been the principal man. He felt that, in view of his apprenticeship
      under those great masters, Jones and Offutt, he was fully competent to
      "run a store," and was impatient to find an opening in that line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for him, the circumstances of the business men of New Salem
      were just then peculiarly favorable to his views. At least three of them
      were as anxious to sell out as Lincoln was to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln, as already stated, was at this time living with "Row" Herndon.
      Row and his brother "Jim" had taken "a store down to New Salem early in
      that year." But Jim "didn't like the place," and sold out his interests to
      an idle, convivial fellow, named Berry. Six weeks later Row Herndon grew
      tired of his new partner, and sold his interest to Lincoln. The store was
      a mixed one,&mdash;dry goods and groceries.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time Mr. Radford, who kept one of the New Salem groceries,
      fell into disfavor with the "Clary's Grove Boys," who generously
      determined that he should keep a grocery no longer. They accordingly
      selected a convenient night for breaking in his windows, and, in their own
      elegant phrase, "gutting his establishment." Convinced that these
      neighborly fellows were inclined to honor him with further attentions, and
      that his bones might share the fate of his windows, Radford determined to
      sell out with the earliest dawn of the coming day. The next day he was
      standing disconsolate in the midst of his wreck, when Bill Green rode up.
      Green thought he saw a speculation in Radford's distress, and offered him
      four hundred dollars for the whole concern. Radford eagerly closed with
      him; and in a few minutes Green owned the grocery, and Radford was ready
      for the road to a more congenial settlement. It is said that Green
      employed Lincoln to make an inventory of the stock. At all events, Lincoln
      was satisfied that Green's bargain was a very good one, and proposed that
      he and Berry should take it off his hands at a premium of two hundred and
      fifty dollars. Radford had Green's note for four hundred dollars; but he
      now surrendered, it and took Lincoln &amp; Berry's for the same amount,
      indorsed by Green; while Lincoln &amp; Berry gave Green a note for two
      hundred and fifty dollars, the latter's profit in the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rutledge "also owned a small grocery in the village;" and this was
      speedily absorbed by the enterprising firm of Lincoln &amp; Berry, who now
      had the field to themselves, being sole proprietors "of the only store of
      the kind in New Salem."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Lincoln sold liquor by the dram over the counter of this shop
      remains, and will forever remain, an undetermined question. Many of his
      friends aver that he did, and as many more aver that he did not. When
      Douglas, with that courtesy for which he distinguished himself in the
      debates with Lincoln, revived the story, Lincoln replied, that, even if it
      were true, there was but little difference between them; for, while he
      figured on one side of the counter, Douglas figured on the other. It is
      certain liquors were a part of the stock of all the purchases of Lincoln
      &amp; Berry. Of course they sold them by the quantity, and probably by the
      drink. Some of it they <i>gave</i> away, for no man could keep store
      without setting out the customary dram to the patrons of the place.1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 Here is the evidence of James Davis, a Democrat, "aged sixty," who is
        willing to "give the Devil his due:"&mdash; "Came to Clary's Grove in
        1829; knew Lincoln well; knew Jim and Row Herndon: they sold out to
        Berry,&mdash;one of them did; afterwards the other sold out to Lincoln.
        The store was a mixed one,&mdash;dry goods, a few groceries, such as
        sugar, salt, &amp;c., and whiskey solely kept for their customers, or to
        sell by the gallon, quart, or pint,&mdash;not otherwise. The Herndons
        probably had the Blankenship goods. Radford had a grocery-store,&mdash;salt,
        pepper, and suchlike things, with whiskey. It is said Green bought this
        out, and instantly sold to Berry &amp; Lincoln. Lincoln &amp; Berry
        broke. Berry subsequently kept a doggery, a whiskey saloon, as I do now,
        or did. Am a Democrat; never agreed in politics with Abe. He was an
        honest man. Give the Devil his due; he never sold whiskey by the dram in
        New Salem! I was in town every week for years; knew, I think, all about
        it. I always drank my dram, and drank at Berry's often; ought to know.
        Lincoln got involved, I think, in the first operation. Salem Hill was a
        barren."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The difficulty of gathering authentic evidence on this subject is well
      illustrated in the following extract from Mr. George Spears of Petersburg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took my horse this morning, and went over to New Salem, among the P&mdash;&mdash;s
      and A&mdash;&mdash;s, and made all the inquiries I could, but could learn
      nothing. The old ladies would begin to count up what had happened in New
      Salem when such a one of their children was born, and such a one had a
      bastard; but it all amounted to nothing. I could arrive at no dates, only
      when those children were born. Old Mrs. Potter affirms that Lincoln did
      sell liquors in a grocery. I can't tell whether he did or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      All that winter (1832-3) Lincoln struggled along with a bad partner, and a
      business which began wrong, and grew worse every day. Berry had no
      qualities which atoned for his evil habits.. He preferred to consume the
      liquors on hand rather than to sell them, and exerted himself so
      successfully, that in a few months he had ruined the credit of the firm,
      squandered its assets, and destroyed his own health. The "store" was a
      dead failure; and the partners were weighed down with a parcel of debts,
      against which Lincoln could scarcely have borne up, even with a better man
      to help him. At last they sold out to two brothers named Trent. The Trents
      continued the business for a few months, when they broke up and ran away.
      Then Berry, encouraged by the example of the Trents, "cleared out" also,
      and, dying soon after, left poor Lincoln the melancholy task of settling
      up the affairs of their ill-starred partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the preceding transactions, the absence of any cash consideration
      is the one thing very striking. It is a fair illustration of the
      speculative spirit pervading the whole people. Green bought from Radford
      on credit; Lincoln &amp; Berry bought from Green on credit; they bought
      from the Herndons on credit; they bought from Rutledge on credit; and they
      sold to the Trents on credit. Those that did not die or run away had a sad
      time enough in managing the debts resulting from their connection with
      this unlucky grocery. Radford assigned Lincoln &amp; Berry's note to a Mr.
      Van Bergen, who got judgment on it, and swept away all Lincoln's little
      personal property, including his surveying instruments,&mdash;his very
      means of livelihood, as we shall see at another place. The Herndons owed
      E. C. Blankenship for the goods they sold, and assigned Lincoln &amp;
      Berry's note in payment. Mr. Lincoln struggled to pay, by slow degrees,
      this harassing debt to Blankenship, through many long and weary years. It
      was not until his return from Congress, in 1849, that he got the last
      dollar of it discharged. He paid Green <i>his</i> note of two hundred and
      fifty dollars, in small instalments, beginning in 1839, and ending in
      1840. The history of his debt to Rutledge is not so well known. It was
      probably insignificant as compared with the others; and Mr. Rutledge
      proved a generous creditor, as he had always been a kind and considerate
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain that he had no abilities for trade, Mr. Lincoln took the best
      resolution he could have formed under the circumstances. He sat down to
      his books just where he was, believing that knowledge would be power, and
      power profit. He had no reason to shun his creditors, for these were the
      men of all others who most applauded the honesty of his conduct at the
      period of his greatest pecuniary misfortune. He talked to them constantly
      of the "old debt," "the national debt," as he sometimes called it,&mdash;promised
      to pay when he could, and they devoutly relied upon every word he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Row Herndon moved to the country, and Lincoln was compelled to change his
      boarding-place. He now began to live at a tavern for the first time in his
      life. It was kept by various persons during his stay,&mdash;first, it
      seems, by Mr. Rutledge, then by Henry Onstatt, and last by Nelson Alley.
      It was a small log-house, covered with clapboards, and contained four
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln began to read law while he lived with Herndon. Some of his
      acquaintances insist that he began even earlier than this, and assert, by
      way of proof, that he was known to borrow a well-worn copy of Blackstone
      from A. T. Bogue, a pork-dealer at Beardstown. At all events, he now went
      to work in earnest, and studied law as faithfully as if he had never
      dreamed of any other business in life. As a matter of course, his slender
      purse was unequal to the purchase of the needful books: but this
      circumstance gave him little trouble; for, although he was short of funds,
      he was long in the legs, and had nothing to do but to walk off to
      Springfield, where his friend, John T. Stuart, cheerfully supplied his
      wants. Mr. Stuart's partner, H. C. Dummer, says, "He was an
      uncouth-looking lad, did not say much, but what he did say he said
      straight and sharp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He used to read law," says Henry McHenry, "in 1832 or 1833, barefooted,
      seated in the shade of a tree, and would grind around with the shade, just
      opposite Berry's grocery-store, a few feet south of the door." He
      occasionally varied the attitude by lying flat on his back, and "<i>putting
      his feet up the tree</i>"&mdash;a situation which might have been
      unfavorable to mental application in the case of a man with shorter
      extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first time I ever saw Abe with a law-book in his hand," says Squire
      Godbey, "he was sitting astride of Jake Bales's woodpile in New Salem.
      Says I, 'Abe, what are you studying?'&mdash;'Law,' says Abe. 'Great God
      Almighty!' responded I." It was too much for Godbey: he could not suppress
      the blasphemy at seeing such a figure acquiring science in such an odd
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minter Graham asserts that Abe did a little "of what we call sitting up to
      the fine gals of Illinois;" but, according to other authorities, he always
      had his book with him "when in company," and would read and talk
      alternately. He carried it along in his walks to the woods and the river;
      read it in daylight under the shade-tree by the grocery, and at night by
      any friendly light he could find,&mdash;most frequently the one he kindled
      himself in the shop of his old benefactor, the cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe's progress in the law was as surprising as the intensity of his
      application to study. He never lost a moment that might be improved. It is
      even said that he read and recited to himself on the road and by the
      wayside as he came down from Springfield with the books he had borrowed
      from Stuart. The first time he went up he had "mastered" forty pages of
      Blackstone before he got back. It was not long until, with his restless
      desire to be doing something practical, he began to turn his acquisitions
      to account in forwarding the business of his neighbors. He wrote deeds,
      contracts, notes, and other legal papers, for them, "using a small
      dictionary and an old form-book;" "petifogged" incessantly before the
      justice of the peace, and probably assisted that functionary in the
      administration of justice as much as he benefited his own clients. This
      species of country "student's" practice was entered upon very early, and
      kept up until long after he was quite a distinguished man in the
      Legislature. But in all this he was only trying himself: as he was not
      admitted to the bar until 1837, he did not regard it as legitimate
      practice, and never charged a penny for his services. Although this fact
      is mentioned by a great number of persons, and the generosity of his
      conduct much enlarged upon, it is seriously to be regretted that no one
      has furnished us with a circumstantial account of any of his numerous
      cases before the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Lincoln did not confine himself entirely to the law. He was not
      yet quite through with Kirkham nor the schoolmaster. The "valuable copy"
      of the grammar "he delighted to peruse" is still in the possession of R.
      B. Rutledge, with the thumb-marks of the President all over it. "He also
      studied natural philosophy, chemistry, astronomy, &amp;c. He had no
      regular teacher, but perhaps received more assistance from Minter Graham
      than from any other person."
    </p>
    <p>
      He read with avidity all the newspapers that came to New Salem,&mdash;chiefly
      "The Sangamon Journal," "The Missouri Republican," and "The Louisville
      Journal." 1 The latter was his favorite: its wit and anecdotes were after
      his own heart; and he was a regular subscriber for it through several
      years when he could ill afford a luxury so costly.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 According to Mr. McNamar, Lincoln took "The Sangamon Journal" and "The
        Louisville Journal" from 1832 to 1837; and Hill and Bale took "The
        Missouri Republican" and "The Cincinnati Gazette." "The Missouri
        Republican" was first issued as a daily in September, 1836. Its size was
        then twenty-five by thirty-six inches.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was never a profound historical student: if he happened to
      need historical facts for the purposes of a political or legal discussion,
      he read them on the spur of the occasion. For this reason his opinions of
      current affairs all through his life were based more upon individual
      observation and reflection than upon scientific deductions from the
      experience of the world. Yet at this time, when he probably felt more
      keenly than ever after the want of a little learning to embellish the
      letters and speeches he was ambitious to compose, he is said to have read
      Rollin's "Ancient History," Gibbon's "Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire,"
      and similar works, with great diligence and care. The books were borrowed
      from William Green, Bowlin Greene, and other parties in and about New
      Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he greatly preferred literature of another sort, such as Mrs. Lee
      Hentz's novels; some of which he found among the effects of Mr. Ellis, at
      the time his companion and occasional bedfellow. "He was very fond," Mr.
      Ellis declares, "of short stories, one and two columns long,&mdash;like
      'Cousin Sally Dillard,' 'Becky Wilson's Courtship,' The Down-easter and
      the Bull,' 'How a bashful man became a married man, with five little
      bashful boys, and how he and his red-headed wife became Millerites, and
      before they were to ascend agreed to make a clean breast of it to each
      other;' and how, when the old lady was through, the Down-easter earnestly
      wished that Gabriel might blow his horn without delay." One New Salemite
      insists that Mr. Lincoln told this latter story "with embezzlements"
      (embellishments), and therefore he is firmly convinced that Mr. Lincoln
      "had a hand" in originating it. The catalogue of literature in which he
      particularly delighted at New Salem is completed by the statement of Mr.
      Rutledge, that he took great pleasure in "Jack Downing's Letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln still relished a popular song with a broad "point" or a
      palpable moral in it as much as he had ever enjoyed the vocal efforts of
      Dennis Hanks and his rollicking compeers of the Gentryville grocery. He
      even continued his own unhappy attempts, although with as little success
      as before, and quite as much to the amusement of his friends. To the
      choice collection of miscellaneous ballads acquired in Indiana, he now
      added several new favorites, like "Old Sukey Blue Skin," and some
      selections from the "Missouri Harmony," with variations by himself. He was
      also singularly fond of an Irish song, "which tells how St. Patrick came
      to be born on the 17th day of March."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask me," says Mr. Ellis, "if I remember the first time I saw Mr.
      Lincoln. Yes, I do.... I was out collecting back tax for Gen. James D.
      Henry. I went from the tavern down to Jacob Bales's old mill, and then I
      first saw Mr. Lincoln. He was sitting on a saw-log talking to Jack and
      Rial Armstrong and a man by the name of Hohammer. I shook hands with the
      Armstrongs and Hohammer, and was conversing with them a few minutes, when
      we were joined by my old friend and former townsman, George Warburton,
      pretty tight as usual; and he soon asked me to tell him the old story
      about Ben Johnson and Mrs. Dale's blue dye, &amp;c., which I did. And then
      Jack Armstrong said, 'Lincoln, tell Ellis the story about Gov. J. Sichner,
      his city-bred son, and his nigger Bob;' which he did, with several others,
      by Jack's calling for them. I found out then that Lincoln was a cousin to
      Charley Hanks of Island Grove. I told him I knew three of the boys,&mdash;Joe,
      Charley, and John,&mdash;and his uncle, old Billy Hanks, who lived up on
      the North Fork of the Sangamon River, afterwards near Decatur."1
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 "I myself knew old Billy Hanks, his mother's brother, and he was a
        very sensible old man. He was father to Mrs. Dillon, on Spring Creek;
        and Charley, Billy, jr., and John were his sons: they were all
        low-flung,&mdash;could neither read nor write. Some of them used to live
        in Island Grove, Sangamon County.... I remember the time that Lincoln
        and E. D. Baker ran in convention, to decide who should run for Congress
        in old Sangamon; that some of Baker's friends accused Mr. Lincoln of
        belonging to a proud and an aristocratic family,&mdash;meaning the
        Edwardses and Todds, I suppose; and, when it came to Mr. Lincoln's ears,
        he laughed heartily, and remarked, 'Well, that sounds strange to me: I
        do not remember of but one that ever came to see me, and while he was in
        town he was accused of stealing a jew's- harp.' Josh Speed remembers his
        saying this. I think you ought to remember it. Beverly Powell and myself
        lived with Bell and Speed, and I think he said so in their store. After
        that a Miss Hanks came to spend the winter with Mrs. Lincoln."&mdash;A.
        Y. Ellis.

      This interview took place shortly after the Black Hawk War; but it was not
      until the next year (1833), the period at which we have now arrived, that
      Lincoln and Ellis became "intimate." At that time Ellis went there to keep
      a store, and boarded "at the same log-tavern" where Lincoln was. Lincoln,
      being "engaged in no particular business," merely endeavoring to make a
      lawyer, a surveyor, and a politician of himself, gave a great deal of his
      time to Ellis and Ellis's business. "He also used to assist me in the
      store," says this new friend, "on busy days, but he always disliked to
      wait on the ladies: he preferred trading with the men and boys, as he used
      to say. I also remember that he used to sleep in the store, on the
      counter, when they had too much company at the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I well remember how he was dressed: he wore flax and tow linen
      pantaloons,&mdash;I thought about five inches too short in the legs,&mdash;and
      frequently he had but one suspender, no vest or coat. He wore a calico
      shirt, such as he had in the Black Hawk War; coarse brogans, tan color;
      blue yarn socks, and straw hat, old style, and without a band.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln was in those days a very shy man of ladies. On one occasion,
      while we boarded at this tavern, there came a family, containing an old
      lady and her son and three stylish daughters, from the State of Virginia,
      and stopped there for two or three weeks; and, during their stay, I do not
      remember of Mr. Lincoln ever eating at the same table when they did. I
      then thought it was on account of his awkward appearance and his wearing
      apparel."
    </p>
    <p>
      There lived at New Salem at this time, and for some years afterward, a
      festive gentleman named Kelso, a school-teacher, a merchant, or a
      vagabond, according to the run of his somewhat variable "luck." When other
      people got drunk at New Salem, it was the usual custom to tussle and
      fight, and tramp each other's toes, and pull each other's noses; but, when
      Kelso got drunk, he astonished the rustic community with copious
      quotations from Robert Burns and William Shakspeare,&mdash;authors little
      known to fame among the literary men of New Salem. Besides Shakspeare and
      Burns, Mr. Kelso was likewise very fond of fishing, and could catch his
      game "when no other man could get a bite." Mr. Lincoln hated fishing with
      all his heart. But it is the testimony of the country-side, from
      Petersburg to Island Grove, that Kelso "drew Lincoln after him by his
      talk;" that they became exceedingly intimate; that they loitered away
      whole days together, along the banks of the quiet streams; that Lincoln
      learned to love inordinately our "divine William" and "Scotia's Bard,"
      whom his friend mouthed in his cups, or expounded more soberly in the
      intervals of fixing bait and dropping line. Finally he and Kelso boarded
      at the same place; and with another "merchant," named Sincho, of tastes
      congenial and wits as keen as Kelso's, they were "always found together,
      battling and arguing." Bill Green ventures the opinion, that Lincoln's
      incessant reading of Shakspeare and Burns had much to do in giving to his
      mind the "sceptical" tendency so fully developed by the labors of his pen
      in 1834-5, and in social conversations during many years of his residence
      at Springfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Offutt, Kelso disappeared suddenly from New Salem, and apparently
      from the recollection of men. Each with a peculiar talent of his own,
      kind-hearted, eccentric creatures, no man's enemy and everybody's prey,
      they strolled out into the great world, and left this little village to
      perish behind them. Of Kelso a few faint traces have been found in
      Missouri; but if he ever had a lodging more permanent than the wayside
      tavern, a haystack, or a hedge, no man was able to tell where it was. Of
      Offutt not a word was ever heard: the most searching and cunning inquiries
      have failed to discover any spot where he lingered for a single hour; and
      but for the humble boy, to whom he was once a gentle master, no human
      being that knew him then would bestow a thought upon his name. In short,
      to use the expressive language of Mr. Lincoln himself, he literally
      "petered out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was often annoyed by "company." His quarters at the tavern
      afforded him little privacy, and the shade of the tree in front of the
      grocery was scarcely a sufficiently secluded situation for the purposes of
      an ardent student. There were too many people to wonder and laugh at a man
      studying law with "his feet up a tree;" too many to worry him for the
      stories and jokes which it was supposed he could furnish on demand. For
      these reasons it became necessary that he should "retire to the country
      occasionally to rest and study." Sometimes he went to James Short's on the
      Sand Ridge; sometimes to Minter Graham's; sometimes to Bowlin Greenes;
      sometimes to Jack Armstrong's, and as often, perhaps, to Able's or Row
      Herndon's. All of these men served him faithfully and signally at one time
      and another, and to all of them he was sincerely attached. When Bowlin
      Greene died, in 1842, Mr. Lincoln, then in the enjoyment of great local
      reputation, undertook to deliver a funeral oration over the remains of his
      beloved friend; but, when he rose to speak, his voice was choked with deep
      emotion: he stood a few moments, while his lips quivered in the effort to
      form the words of fervent praise he sought to utter, and the tears ran
      down his yellow and shrivelled cheeks. Some of those who came to hear him,
      and saw his tall form thus sway in silence over the body of Bowlin Greene,
      say he looked so helpless, so utterly bereft and pitiable, that every
      heart in the audience was hushed at the spectacle. After repeated efforts,
      he found it impossible to speak, and strode away, openly and bitterly
      sobbing, to the widow's carriage, in which he was driven from the scene.
      Mr. Herndon's papers disclose less than we should like to know concerning
      this excellent man: they give us only this burial scene, with the fact
      that Bowlin Greene had loaned Mr. Lincoln books from their earliest
      acquaintance, and on one occasion had taken him to his home, and cared for
      him with the solicitude of a devoted friend through several weeks of great
      suffering and peril. The circumstances of the attempted eulogy are
      mentioned here to show the relations which subsisted between Mr. Lincoln
      and some of the benefactors we have enumerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this time Mr. Lincoln had a living to make, a running board-bill
      to pay, and nothing to pay it with. He was, it is true, in the hands of
      excellent friends, so far as the greater part of his indebtedness was
      concerned; but he was industrious by nature, and wanted to be working, and
      paying as he went. He would not have forfeited the good opinion of those
      confiding neighbors for a lifetime of ease and luxury. It was therefore a
      most happy thing for him, and he felt it to be so, when he attracted the
      attention of John Calhoun, the surveyor of Sangamon County.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun was the type of a perfect gentleman,&mdash;brave, courteous, able,
      and cultivated. He was a Democrat then, and a Democrat when he died. All
      the world knows how he was president of the Lecompton Convention; how he
      administered the trust in accordance with his well-known convictions; and
      how, after a life of devotion to Douglas, he was adroitly betrayed by that
      facile politician, and left to die in the midst of obloquy and disaster.
      At the time we speak of, he was one of the most popular men in the State
      of Illinois, and was one of the foremost chieftains of the political party
      which invariably carried the county and the district in which Mr. Lincoln
      lived. He knew Lincoln, and admired him. He was well assured that Lincoln
      knew nothing of surveying; but he was equally certain that he could soon
      acquire it. The speculative fever was at its height; he was overrun with
      business: the country was alive with strangers seeking land; and every
      citizen was buying and selling with a view to a great fortune in the
      "flush times" coming. He wanted a deputy with common sense and common
      honesty: he chose Lincoln, because nobody else possessed these qualities
      in a more eminent degree. He hunted him up; gave him a book; told him to
      study it, and said, that, as soon as he was ready, he should have as much
      work as he could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln took the book, and "retired to the country;" that is, he went out
      to Minter Graham's for about six weeks, in which time, by the aid of that
      good master, he became an expert surveyor, and was duly appointed
      Calhoun's deputy. Of course he made some money, merely his pay for work;
      but it is a remarkable fact, that, with his vast knowledge of the lands in
      Sangamon and adjacent counties, he never made a single speculation on his
      own account. It was not long until he acquired a considerable private
      business. The accuracy of his surveys were seldom, if ever, questioned.
      Disputes regarding "corners" and "lines" were frequently submitted to his
      arbitration; and the decision was invariably accepted as final. It often
      happened that his business kept him away from New Salem, and his other
      studies, for weeks at a time; but all this while he was gathering friends
      against the day of election.
    </p>
    <p>
      In after years&mdash;from 1844 onward&mdash;it was his good or bad fortune
      frequently to meet Calhoun on the stump; but he never forgot his
      benefaction to him, and always regarded him as the ablest and best man
      with whom he ever had crossed steel. To the day of Calhoun's death they
      were warmly attached to each other. In the times when it was most
      fashionable and profitable to denounce Calhoun and the Le-compton
      Constitution, when even Douglas turned to revile his old friend and
      coadjutor, Mr. Lincoln was never known to breathe a word of censure on his
      personal character.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of May, 1833, Mr. Lincoln was appointed postmaster at New
      Salem. His political opinions were not extreme; and the Jackson
      administration could find no man who was at the same time more orthodox
      and equally competent to perform the duties of the office. He was not able
      to rent a room, for the business is said to have been carried on in his
      hat; but, from the evidence before us, we imagine that he kept the office
      in Mr. Hill's store, Mr. Hill's partner, McNamar, having been absent since
      1832. He held the place until late in 1836, when New Salem partially
      disappeared, and the office was removed to Petersburg. For a little while
      before his own appointment, he is said to have acted as
      "deputy-postmaster" under Mr. Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mail arrived duly once a week; and the labors of distributing and
      delivering it were by no means great. But Mr. Lincoln was determined that
      the dignity of the place should not suffer while he was the incumbent. He
      therefore made up for the lack of real business by deciphering the letters
      of the uneducated portion of the community, and by reading the newspapers
      aloud to the assembled inhabitants in front of Hill's store.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his easy good-nature was sometimes imposed upon by inconsiderate
      acquaintances; and Mr. Hill relates one of the devices by which he sought
      to stop the abuse. "One Elmore Johnson, an ignorant but ostentatious,
      proud man, used to go to Lincoln's post-office every day,&mdash;sometimes
      three or four times a day, if in town,&mdash;and inquire, 'Any thing for
      me?' This bored Lincoln, yet it amused him. Lincoln fixed a plan,&mdash;wrote
      a letter to Johnson as coming from a negress in Kentucky, saying many good
      things about opossum, dances, corn-shuckings, &amp;c.; 'John's! come and
      see me; and old master won't kick you out of the kitchen any more!' Elmore
      took it out; opened it; couldn't read a word; pretended to read it; went
      away; got some friends to read it: they read it correctly; he thought the
      reader was fooling him, and went to others with the same result. At last
      he said he would get <i>Lincoln</i> to read it, and presented it to
      Lincoln. It was almost too much for Lincoln, but he read it. The man never
      asked afterwards, 'Any thing here for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the latter part of 1834 that Mr. Lincoln's personal property was
      sold under the hammer, and by due process of law, to meet the judgment
      obtained by Van Bergen on the note assigned to him by Radford. Every thing
      he had was taken; but it was the surveyor's instruments which it hurt him
      most to part with, for by their use he was making a tolerable living, and
      building up a respectable business. This time, however, rescue came from
      an unexpected quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Lincoln first came to New Salem, he employed a woman to make him
      a pair of pantaloons, which, probably from the scarcity of material, were
      cut entirely too short, as his garments usually were. Soon afterwards the
      woman's brother came to town, and she pointed Abe out to him as he walked
      along the street. The brother's name was James Short. "Without the
      necessity of a formal introduction," says Short, "we fell in together, and
      struck up a conversation, the purport of which I have now forgotten. He
      made a favorable impression upon me by his conversation on first
      acquaintance through his intelligence and sprightliness, which impression
      was deepened from time to time, as I became better acquainted with him."
      This was a lucky "impression" for Abe. Short was a fast friend, and in the
      day of trouble a sure and able one. At the time the judgment was obtained,
      Short lived on the Sand Ridge, four miles from New Salem; and Lincoln was
      in the habit of walking out there almost daily. Short was then unconscious
      of the main reason of Mr. Lincoln's remarkable devotion to him: there was
      a lady in the house whom Lincoln secretly but earnestly loved, and of whom
      there is much to be said at another place. If the host had known every
      thing, however, poor Abe would have been equally welcome; for he made
      himself a strangely agreeable guest here, as he did everywhere else. In
      busy times he pulled off his roundabout, and helped Short in the field
      with more energy than any hired man would have displayed. "He was," said
      Short, "the best hand at husking corn on the stalk I ever saw. I used to
      consider myself very good; but he would gather two loads to my one."
    </p>
    <p>
      These visits increased Short's disposition to serve him; and it touched
      him sorely when he heard Lincoln moaning about the catastrophe that hung
      over him in the form of Van Bergen's judgment. "An execution was issued,"
      says he, "and levied on Lincoln's horse, saddle, bridle, compass, chain,
      and other surveyor's instruments. He was then very much discouraged, and
      said he would let the whole thing go by the board. He was at my house very
      much,&mdash;half the time. I did all I could to put him in better spirits.
      I went on the delivery-bond with him; and when the sale came off, which
      Mr. Lincoln did not attend, I bid in the above property at a hundred and
      twenty dollars, and immediately gave it up again to him. Mr. Lincoln
      afterwards repaid me when he had moved to Springfield. Greene also turned
      in on this judgment his horse, saddle, and bridle at a hundred and
      twenty-five dollars; and Lincoln afterwards repaid him."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, Mr. Lincoln had no friend more intimate than Jack
      Armstrong, and none that valued him more highly. Until he finally left New
      Salem for Springfield, he "rusticated" occasionally at Jack's hospitable
      cabin, situated "four miles in the country," as the polished metropolitans
      of New Salem would say. Jack's wife, Hannah, before alluded to, liked Abe,
      and enjoyed his visits not less than Jack did. "Abe would come out to our
      house," she says, "drink milk, eat mush, corn-bread, and butter, bring the
      children candy, and rock the cradle while I got him something to eat.... I
      foxed his pants; made his shirts... He has gone with us to father's; he
      would tell stories, joke people, girls and boys, at parties. He would
      nurse babies,&mdash;do any thing to accommodate anybody.... I had no books
      about my house; loaned him none. We didn't think about books and papers.
      We worked; had to live. Lincoln has staid at our house two or three weeks
      at a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jack had "to work to live," as his wife has it, he was likewise
      constrained to fight and wrestle and tumble about with his unhappy
      fellow-citizens, in order to enjoy the life he earned by labor. He
      frequently came "to town," where his sportive inclinations ran riot,
      except as they were checked and regulated by the amicable interposition of
      Abe,&mdash;the prince of his affections, and the only man who was
      competent to restrain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The children at school had made a wide sliding walk," from the top of
      Salem Hill to the river-bank, down which they rode on sleds and boards,&mdash;a
      distance of two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards. Now, it was one
      of the suggestions of Jack's passion for innocent diversion to nail up in
      hogsheads such of the population as incurred his displeasure, and send
      them adrift along this frightful descent. Sol. Spears and one Scanlon were
      treated to an adventure of this kind; but the hogshead in which the two
      were caged "leaped over an embankment, and came near killing Scanlon."
      After that the sport was considered less amusing, and was very much
      discouraged by that portion of the community who feared, that, in the
      absence of more convenient victims, "the boys" might light on them. Under
      these circumstances, Jack, for once in his life, thought it best to
      abandon coercion, and negotiate for subjects. He selected an elderly
      person of bibulous proclivities, and tempted him with a great temptation.
      "Old man Jordan <i>agreed</i> to be rolled down the hill for a gallon of
      whiskey;" but Lincoln, fully impressed with the brutality of the pastime,
      and the danger to the old sot, "stopped it." Whether he did it by
      persuasion or force, we know not, but probably by a judicious employment
      of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember once," says Mr. Ellis, "of seeing Mr. Lincoln out of temper,
      and laughing at the same time. It was at New Salem. The boys were having a
      jollification after an election. They had a large fire made of shavings
      and hemp-stalks; and some of the boys made a bet with a fellow that I
      shall call 'Ike,' that he couldn't run his little bob-tail pony through
      the fire. Ike took them up, and trotted his pony back about one hundred
      yards, to give him a good start, as he said. The boys all formed a line on
      either side, to make way for Ike and his pony. Presently here he come,
      full tilt, with his hat off; and, just as he reached the blazing fire, Ike
      raised in his saddle for the jump straight ahead; but pony was not of the
      same opinion, so he flew the track, and pitched poor Ike into the
      devouring element. Mr. Lincoln saw it, and ran to his assistance, saying,
      'You have carried this thing far enough.' I could see he was mad, though
      he could not help laughing himself. The poor fellow was considerably
      scorched about the head and face. Jack Armstrong took him to the doctor,
      who shaved his head to fix him up, and put salve on the burn. I think Mr.
      Lincoln was a little mad at Armstrong, and Jack himself was very sorry for
      it. Jack gave Ike next morning a dram, his breakfast, and a seal-skin cap,
      and sent him home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One cold winter day, Lincoln saw a poor fellow named "Ab Trent" hard at
      work chopping up "a house," which Mr. Hill had employed him to convert
      into firewood. Ab was barefooted, and shivered pitifully while he worked.
      Lincoln watched him a few moments, and asked him what he was to get for
      the job. Ab answered, 'One dollar;' and, pointing to his naked and
      suffering feet, said that he wished to buy a pair of shoes. Lincoln seized
      the axe, and, ordering the boy to comfort himself at the nearest fire,
      chopped up 'the house' so fast that Ab and the owner were both amazed when
      they saw it done." According to Mr. Rutledge, "Ab remembered this act with
      the liveliest gratitude. Once he, being a cast-iron Democrat, determined
      to vote against his party and for Mr. Lincoln; but the friends, as he
      afterwards said with tears in his eyes, made him drunk, and he had voted
      against Abe. Thus he did not even have an opportunity to return the noble
      conduct of Mr. Lincoln by this small measure of thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      We have given some instances of Mr. Lincoln's unfailing disposition to
      succor the weak and the unfortunate. He never seems to have hesitated on
      account of actual or fancied danger to himself, but boldly espoused the
      side of the oppressed against the oppressor, whoever and whatever the
      latter might be. In a fisticuff or a rough-and-tumble fight, he was one of
      the most formidable men of the region in which he lived. It took a big
      bully, and a persevering one, to force him into a collision; but, being
      in, his enemy found good reason to beware of him. He was cool,
      calculating, but swift in action, and terribly strong. Nevertheless, he
      never promoted a quarrel, and would be at infinite trouble any time to
      compose one. An unnecessary broil gave him pain; and whenever there was
      the slightest hope of successful mediation, whether by soft speech or by
      the strong hand, he was instant and fearless for peace. His good-nature,
      his humor, his fertility in expedients, and his alliance, offensive and
      defensive, with Jack Armstrong, made him almost irresistible in his
      benevolent efforts to keep the ordinary ruffian of New Salem within decent
      bounds. If he was talking to Squire Godbey or Row Herndon (each of them
      give incidents of the kind), and he heard the sounds or saw the signs
      which betoken a row in the street, he would jump up, saying, "Let's go and
      stop it." He would push through the "ring" which was generally formed
      around the combatants, and, after separating the latter, would demand a
      truce and "a talk;" and so soon as he got them to talking, the victory was
      his. If it happened to be rough Jack himself who was at the bottom of the
      disturbance, he usually became very much ashamed of his conduct, and
      offered to "treat," or do any thing else that would atone for his
      brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln has often been seen in the old mill on the river-bank to lift a
      box of stones weighing from a thousand to twelve hundred pounds. Of course
      it was not done by a straight lift of the hands: he "was harnessed to the
      box with ropes and straps." It was even said he could easily raise a
      barrel of whiskey to his mouth when standing upright, and take a drink out
      of the bung-hole; but of course one cannot believe it. Frequent
      exhibitions of such strength doubtless had much to do with his unbounded
      influence over the rougher class of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He possessed the judicial quality of mind in a degree so eminent, and it
      was so universally recognized, that he never could attend a horse-race
      without being importuned to act as a judge, or witness a bet without
      assuming the responsibility of a stakeholder. "In the spring or summer of
      1832," says Henry McHenry, "I had a horse-race with George Warbur-ton. I
      got Lincoln, who was at the race, to be a judge of the race, much against
      his will and after hard persuasion. Lincoln decided correctly; and the
      other judge said, 'Lincoln is the fairest man I ever bad to deal with: if
      Lincoln is in this county when I die, I want him to be my administrator,
      for he is the only man I ever met with that was wholly and unselfishly
      honest.'" His ineffable purity in determining the result of a scrub-race
      had actually set his colleague to thinking of his latter end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lincoln endured another annoyance much worse than this. He was so
      generally esteemed, and so highly admired, that, when any of his neighbors
      had a fight in prospect, one of the parties was sure to insist upon his
      acting as his second. Lincoln was opposed to fights, but there were some
      fights that had to be fought; and these were "set," a day fixed, and the
      neighborhood notified. In these cases there was no room for the offices of
      a mediator; and when the affair was pre-ordained, "and must come off," Mr.
      Lincoln had no excuse for denying the request of a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two neighbors, Harry Clark and Ben Wilcox," says Mr. Rutledge, "had had a
      lawsuit. The defeated declared, that, although he was beaten in the suit,
      he could whip his opponent. This was a formal challenge, and was at once
      carried to the ears of the victor (Wilcox), and as promptly accepted. The
      time, place, and seconds were chosen with due regularity; Mr. Lincoln
      being Clark's, and John Brewer, Wilcox's second. The parties met, stripped
      themselves all but their breeches, went in, and Mr. Lincoln's principal
      was beautifully whipped. These combats were conducted with as much
      ceremony and punctiliousness as ever graced the duelling-ground. After the
      conflict, the seconds conducted their respective principals to the river,
      washed off the blood, and assisted them to dress. During this performance,
      the second of the party opposed to Mr. Lincoln remarked, 'Well, Abe, my
      man has whipped yours, and I can whip you.' Now, this challenge came from
      a man who was very small in size. Mr. Lincoln agreed to fight, provided he
      would chalk out his size on Mr. Lincoln's person, and every blow struck
      outside of that mark should be counted foul. After this sally, there was
      the best possible humor, and all parties were as orderly as if they had
      been engaged in the most harmless amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1834 Lincoln was again a candidate for the Legislature, and this time
      was elected by a larger majority than any other man on the ticket. By this
      time the party with which he acted in the future was "discriminated as
      Whig;" and he did not hesitate to call himself a Whig, although he sought
      and received the votes of a great many Democrats. Just before the time had
      arrived for candidates to announce themselves, he went to John T. Stuart,
      and told him "the Democrats wanted to run him." He made the same statement
      to Ninian W. Edwards. Edwards and Stuart were both his personal and
      political friends, and they both advised him to let the Democrats have
      their way. Major Stuart's advice was certainly disinterested; for, in
      pursuance of it, two of the Whig candidates, Lincoln and Dawson, made a
      bargain with the Democrats which very nearly proved fatal to Stuart
      himself. He was at that time the favorite candidate of the Whigs for the
      Legislature; but the conduct of Lincoln and Dawson so demoralized the
      party, that his vote was seriously diminished. Up to this time Sangamon
      had been stanchly Democratic; but even in this election of 1834 we
      perceive slight evidences of that party's decay, and so early as 1836 the
      county became thoroughly Whig.

    <p>
      We shall give no details of this campaign, since we should only be
      repeating what is written of the campaign of 1832. But we cannot withhold
      one extract from the reminiscences of Mr. Row Herndon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He (Lincoln) came to my house, near Island Grove, during harvest. There
      were some thirty men in the field. He got his dinner, and went out in the
      field where the men were at work. I gave him an introduction, and the boys
      said that they could not vote for a man unless he could make a hand.
      'Well, boys,' said he, 'if that is all, I am sure of your votes.' He took
      hold of the cradle, and led the way all the round with perfect ease. The
      boys were satisfied, and I don't think he lost a vote in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day was speaking at Berlin. He went from my house with Dr.
      Barnett, the man that had asked me who this man Lincoln was. I told him
      that he was a candidate for the Legislature. He laughed and said, 'Can't
      the party raise no better material than that?' I said, 'Go to-morrow, and
      hear all before you pronounce judgment.' When he came back, I said,
      'Doctor, what say you now?' 'Why, sir,' said he, 'he is a perfect take-in:
      he knows more than all of them put together.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln got 1,376 votes, Dawson 1,370, Carpenter 1,170, Stuart 1,164.
      Lincoln was at last duly elected a Representative by a very flattering
      majority, and began to look about for the pecuniary means necessary to
      maintain his new dignity. In this extremity he had recourse to an old
      friend named Coleman Smoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in 1832, while he was clerking for Offutt, a stranger came into
      the store, and soon disclosed the fact that his name was Smoot. Abe was
      behind the counter at the moment; but, hearing the name, he sprang over
      and introduced himself. Abe had often heard of Smoot, and Smoot had often
      heard of Abe. They had been as anxious to meet as ever two celebrities
      were; but hitherto they had never been able to manage it. "Smoot," said
      Lincoln, after a steady survey of his person, "I am very much disappointed
      in you: I expected to see an old Probst of a fellow." (Probst, it appears,
      was the most hideous specimen of humanity in all that country.) "Yes,"
      replied Smoot; "and I am equally disappointed, for I expected to see a
      good-looking man when I saw you." A few neat compliments like the
      foregoing laid the foundation of a lasting intimacy between the two men,
      and in his present distress Lincoln knew no one who would be more likely
      than Smoot to respond favorably to an application for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After he was elected to the Legislature," says Mr. Smoot, "he came to my
      house one day in company with Hugh Armstrong. Says he, 'Smoot, did you
      vote for me?' I told him I did. 'Well,' says he, 'you must loan me money
      to buy suitable clothing, for I want to make a decent appearance in the
      Legislature.' I then loaned him two hundred dollars, which he returned to
      me according to promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval between the election and his departure for the seat of
      government was employed by Mr. Lincoln partly in reading, partly in
      writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The community in which he lived was pre-eminently a community of
      free-thinkers in matters of religion; and it was then no secret, nor has
      it been a secret since, that Mr. Lincoln agreed with the majority of his
      associates in denying to the Bible the authority of divine revelation. It
      was his honest belief,&mdash;a belief which it was no reproach to hold at
      New Salem, Anno Domini 1834, and one which he never thought of concealing.
      It was no distinction, either good or bad, no honor, and no shame. But he
      had made himself thoroughly familiar with the writings of Paine and
      Volney,&mdash;"The Ruins" by one and "The Age of Reason" by the other. His
      mind was full of the subject, and he felt an itching to write. He did
      write, and the result was a "little book." It was probably merely an
      extended essay; but it is ambitiously spoken of as "a book" by himself and
      by the persons who were made acquainted with its contents. In this work he
      intended to demonstrate,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>"First, that the Bible was not God's revelation; and,</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>"Secondly, that Jesus was not the Son of God."</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      These were his leading propositions, and surely they were comprehensive
      enough; but the reader will be better able to guess at the arguments by
      which they were sustained, when he has examined some of the evidence
      recorded in Chapter XIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      No leaf of this little volume has survived. Mr. Lincoln carried it in
      manuscript to the store of Mr. Samuel Hill, where it was read and
      discussed. Hill was himself an unbeliever, but his son considered this
      book "infamous." It is more than probable that Hill, being a warm personal
      friend of Lincoln, feared that the publication of the essay would some day
      interfere with the political advancement of his favorite. At all events,
      he snatched it out of his hand, and thrust it into the fire, from which
      not a shred escaped. The sequel will show that even Mr. Hill's provident
      forethought was not altogether equal to the prevention of the injury he
      dreaded.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE reader is already familiar with the name of James Rutledge, the
      founder of New Salem, and the owner in part of the famous mill on the
      Sangamon. He was born in South Carolina, and was of the illustrious
      Rutledge family of that State. From South Carolina he emigrated to
      Kentucky, and thence to Illinois. In 1828 he settled at New Salem, built
      the mill and laid out the village in conjunction with Mr. Cameron, a
      retired minister of the Cumberland Presbyterians. Mr. Rutledge's character
      seems to have been pure and high; for wherever his name occurs in the
      voluminous records before us,&mdash;in the long talks and the numerous
      epistles of his neighbors,&mdash;it is almost invariably coupled with some
      expression of genuine esteem and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, and along with his other business,&mdash;which appears to
      have been quite extensive and various,&mdash;Mr. Rutledge kept the tavern,
      the small house with four rooms on the main street of New Salem, just
      opposite Lincoln's grocery. There Mr. Lincoln came to board late in 1832,
      or early in 1833. The family consisted of the father, mother, and nine
      children,&mdash;three of them born in Kentucky and six in Illinois; three
      grown up, and the rest quite young. Ann, the principal subject of this
      chapter, was the third child. She was born on the 7th of January, 1813,
      and was about nineteen years of age when Mr. Lincoln came to live in the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ann was a little maiden just turned of seventeen, and still attending
      the school of that redoubtable pedagogue Min-ter Graham, there came to New
      Salem a young gentleman of singular enterprise, tact, and capacity for
      business. He is identical with the man whom we have already quoted as "the
      pioneer of New Salem as a business point," and who built the first
      storehouse there at the extravagant cost of fifteen dollars. He took
      boarding with Mr. Rutledge's friend and partner, James Cameron, and gave
      out his name as John McNeil. He came to New Salem with no other capital
      than good sense and an active and plucky spirit; but somehow fortune
      smiled indiscriminately on all his endeavors, and very soon&mdash;as early
      as the latter part of 1832&mdash;he found himself a well-to-do and
      prosperous man, owning a snug farm seven miles north of New Salem, and a
      half-interest in the largest store of the place. This latter property his
      partner, Samuel Hill, bought from him at a good round sum; for McNeil now
      announced his intention of being absent for a brief period, and his
      purpose was such that he might need all his available capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the partners, Hill and McNeil, had both fallen in love
      with Ann Rutledge, and both courted her with devoted assiduity. But the
      contest had long since been decided in favor of McNeil, and Ann loved him
      with all her susceptible and sensitive heart. When the time drew near for
      McNeil to depart, he confided to Ann a strange story,&mdash;and, in the
      eyes of a person less fond, a very startling story. His name was not John
      McNeil at all, but John McNamar. His family was a highly respectable one
      in the State of New York; but a few years before his father had failed in
      business, and there was great distress at home. He (John) then conceived
      the romantic plan of running away, and, at some undefined place in the far
      West, making a sudden fortune with which to retrieve the family disaster.
      He fled accordingly, changed his name to avoid the pursuit of his father,
      found his way to New Salem, and&mdash;she knew the rest. He was now able
      to perform that great act of filial piety which he set out to accomplish,
      would return at once to the relief of his parents, and, in all human
      probability, bring them back with him to his new home in Illinois. At all
      events, she might look for his return as speedily as the journey could be
      made with ordinary diligence; and thenceforward there should be no more
      partings between him and his fair Ann. She believed this tale, because she
      loved the man that told it; and she would have believed it all the same if
      it had been ten times as incredible. A wise man would have rejected it
      with scorn, but the girl's instinct was a better guide; and McNamar proved
      to be all that he said he was, although poor Ann never saw the proof which
      others got of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      McNamar rode away "on old Charley," an antiquated steed that had seen hard
      usage in the Black Hawk War. Charley was slow, stumbled dreadfully, and
      caused his rider much annoyance and some hard swearing. On this provoking
      animal McNamar jogged through the long journey from New Salem to New York,
      and arrived there after many delays, only to find that his broken and
      dispirited father was fast sinking into the grave. After all his efforts,
      he was too late: the father could never enjoy the prosperity which the
      long-absent and long-silent son had brought him. McNamar wrote to Ann that
      there was sickness in the family, and he could not return at the time
      appointed. Then there were other and still other postponements;
      "circumstances over which he had no control" prevented his departure from
      time to time, until years had rolled away, and Ann's heart had grown sick
      with hope deferred. She never quite gave him up, but continued to expect
      him until death terminated her melancholy watch. His inexplicable delay,
      however, the infrequency of his letters, and their unsatisfactory
      character,&mdash;these and something else had broken her attachment, and
      toward the last she waited for him only to ask a release from her
      engagement, and to say that she preferred another and a more urgent
      suitor. But without his knowledge and formal renunciation of his claim
      upon her, she did not like to marry; and, in obedience to this refinement
      of honor, she postponed her union with the more pressing lover until Aug.
      25, 1835, when, as many persons believe, she died of a broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln's friend Short was in some way related to the Rutledges, and for a
      while Lincoln visited Ann two or three times a week at his house.
      According to him, "Miss Rutledge was a good-looking, smart, lively girl, a
      good housekeeper, with a moderate education, and without any of the
      so-called accomplishments." L. M. Greene, who knew her well, talks about
      her as "a beautiful and very amiable young woman;" and "Nult" Greene is
      even more enthusiastic. "This young lady," in the language of the latter
      gentleman, "was a woman of exquisite beauty; but her intellect was quick,
      sharp, deep, and philosophic, as well as brilliant. She had as gentle and
      kind a heart as an angel, full of love, kindliness, and sympathy. She was
      beloved by everybody, and everybody respected and loved her, so sweet and
      angelic was she. Her character was more than good: it was positively noted
      throughout the county. She was a woman worthy of Lincoln's love." McNamar,
      her unfortunate lover, says, "Miss Ann was a gentle, amiable maiden,
      without any of the airs of your city belles, but winsome and comely
      withal; a blonde in complexion, with golden hair, cherry-red lips, and a
      bonny blue eye." Even the women of the neighborhood united with the men to
      praise the name of this beautiful but unhappy girl. Mrs. Hardin Bale "knew
      her well. She had auburn hair, blue eyes, fair complexion; was a slim,
      pretty, kind, tender, good-hearted woman; in height about five feet three
      inches, and weighed about a hundred and twenty pounds. She was beloved by
      all who knew her. McNamar, Hill, and Lincoln all courted her near the same
      time. She died as it were of grief. Miss Rutledge was beautiful." Such was
      Ann Rutledge, the girl in whose grave Mr. Lincoln said, "My heart lies
      buried." When Mr. Lincoln first saw Ann, she was probably the most refined
      woman with whom he had then ever spoken,&mdash;a modest, delicate
      creature, fascinating by reason of the mere contrast with the rude people
      by whom they were both surrounded. She had a secret, too, and a sorrow,&mdash;the
      unexplained and painful absence of McNamar,&mdash;which no doubt made her
      all the more interesting to him whose spirit was often even more
      melancholy than her own. It would be hard to trace the growth of such an
      attachment at a time and place so distant; but that it actually grew, and
      became an intense and mutual passion, the evidence before us is painfully
      abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was always welcome at the little tavern, at Short's on the
      Sand Ridge, or at the farm, half a mile from Short's, where the Rutledges
      finally abode. Ann's father was his devoted friend, and the mother he
      called affectionately "Aunt Polly." It is probable that the family looked
      upon McNamar's delay with more suspicion than Ann did herself. At all
      events, all her adult relatives encouraged the suit which Lincoln early
      began to press; and as time, absence, and apparent neglect, gradually told
      against McNamar, she listened to him with augmenting interest, until, in
      1835, we find them formally and solemnly betrothed. Ann now waited only
      for the return of McNamar to marry Lincoln. David Rutledge urged her to
      marry immediately, without regard to any thing but her own happiness; but
      she said she could not consent to it until McNamar came back and released
      her from her pledge. At length, however, as McNamar's re-appearance became
      more and more hopeless, she took a different view of it, and then thought
      she would become Abe's wife as soon as he found the means of a decent
      livelihood. "Ann told me once," says James M. in a letter to R. B.
      Rutledge, in coming from camp-meeting on Rock Creek, "that engagements
      made too far ahead sometimes failed; that one <i>had</i> failed (meaning
      her engagement with McNamar), and gave me to understand, that, as soon as
      certain studies were completed, she and Lincoln would be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1835 Ann showed unmistakable symptoms of failing health,
      attributable, as most of the neighborhood believed, to the distressing
      attitude she felt bound to maintain between her two lovers. On the 25th of
      August, in that year, she died of what the doctors chose to call
      "brain-fever." In a letter to Mr. Herndon, her brother says, "You suggest
      that the probable cause of Ann's sickness was her conflicts, emotions,
      &amp;c. As to this I cannot say. I, however, have my own private
      convictions. The character of her sickness was brain-fever." A few days
      before her death Lincoln was summoned to her bedside. What happened in
      that solemn conference was known only to him and the dying girl. But when
      he left her, and stopped at the house of John Jones, on his way home,
      Jones saw signs of the most terrible distress in his face and his conduct.
      When Ann actually died, and was buried, his grief became frantic: he lost
      all self-control, even the consciousness of identity, and every friend he
      had in New Salem pronounced him insane, mad, crazy. "He was watched with
      especial vigilance," as William Green tells us, "during storms, fogs,
      damp, gloomy weather, for fear of an accident." "At such times he raved
      piteously, declaring, among other wild expressions of his woe, 'I can
      never be reconciled to have the snow, rains, and storms to beat upon her
      grave!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      About three-quarters of a mile below New Salem, at the foot of the main
      bluff, and in a hollow between two lateral bluffs, stood the house of
      Bowlin Greene, built of logs and weather-boarded. Thither the friends of
      Lincoln, who apprehended a total abdication of reason, determined to
      transport him, partly for the benefit of a mere change of scene, and
      partly to keep him within constant reach of his near and noble friend,
      Bowlin Greene. During this period of his darkened and wavering intellect,
      when "accidents" were momentarily expected, it was discovered that Bowlin
      Greene possessed a power to persuade and guide him proportioned to the
      affection that had subsisted between them in former and better times.
      Bowlin Greene came for him, but Lincoln was cunning and obstinate: it
      required the most artful practices of a general conspiracy of all his
      friends to "disarm his suspicions," and induce him to go and stay with his
      most anxious and devoted friend. But at last they succeeded; and Lincoln
      remained down under the bluff for two or three weeks, the object of
      undisguised solicitude and of the strictest surveillance. At the end of
      that time his mind seemed to be restored, and it was thought safe to let
      him go back to his old haunts,&mdash;to the study of law, to the writing
      of legal papers for his neighbors, to pettifogging before the justice of
      the peace, and perhaps to a little surveying. But Mr. Lincoln was never
      precisely the same man again. At the time of his release he was thin,
      haggard, and careworn,&mdash;like one risen from the verge of the grave.
      He had always been subject to fits of great mental depression, but after
      this they were more frequent and alarming. It was then that he began to
      repeat, with a feeling which seemed to inspire every listener with awe,
      and to carry him to the fresh grave of Ann at every one of his solemn
      periods, the lines entitled, "Immortality; or, Oh! why should the spirit
      of mortal be proud?" None heard him but knew that he selected these
      curiously empty, yet wonderfully sad, impressive lines, to celebrate a
      grief which lay with continual heaviness on his heart, but to which he
      could not with becoming delicacy directly allude. He muttered them as he
      rambled through the woods, or walked by the roaring Sangamon. He was heard
      to murmur them to himself as he slipped into the village at nightfall,
      after a long walk of six miles, and an evening visit to the Concord
      graveyard; and he would suddenly break out with them in little social
      assemblies after noticeable periods of silent gloom. They came unbidden to
      his lips, while the air of affliction in face and gesture, the moving
      tones and touching modulations of his voice, made it evident that every
      syllable of the recitation was meant to commemorate the mournful fate of
      Ann. The poem is now his: the name of the obscure author is forgotten, and
      his work is imperishably associated with the memory of a great man, and
      interwoven with the history of his greatest Sorrow. Mr. Lincoln's adoption
      of it has saved it from merited oblivion, and translated it from the
      "poet's corner" of the country newspaper to a place in the story of his
      own life,&mdash;a story that will continue to be written, or written
      about, as long as our language exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years afterwards, when Mr. Lincoln, the best lawyer of his section,
      with one exception, travelled the circuit with the court and a crowd of
      his jolly brethren, he always rose early, be fore any one else was
      stirring, and, raking together a few glowing coals on the hearth, he would
      sit looking into them, musing and talking with himself, for hours
      together. One morning, in the year of his nomination, his companions found
      him in this attitude, when "Mr. Lincoln repeated aloud, and at length, the
      poem 'Immortality,'" indicating his preference for the two last stanzas,
      but insisting that the entire composition "sounded to him as much like
      true poetry as any thing that he had ever heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Carpenter's "Anecdotes and Reminiscences of President Lincoln," occurs
      the following passage:&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The evening of March 22, 1864, was a most interesting one to me. I was
      with the President alone in his office for several hours. Busy with pen
      and papers when I went in, he presently threw them aside, and commenced
      talking to me of Shakspeare, of whom he was very fond. Little 'Tad,' his
      son, coming in, he sent him to the library for a copy of the plays, and
      then read to me several of his favorite passages. Relapsing into a sadder
      strain, he laid the book aside, and, leaning back in his chair, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'There is a poem which has been a great favorite with me for years, which
      was first shown to me when a young man by a friend, and which I afterwards
      saw and cut from a newspaper, and learned by heart. I would,' he
      continued, 'give a great deal to know who wrote it; but I have never been
      able to ascertain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, half closing his eyes, he repeated the verses to me:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "'Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud? Like a swift-fleeting
        meteor, a fast-flying cloud, A flash of the lightning, a break of the
        wave, He passeth from life to his rest in the grave. The leaves of the
        oak and the willow shall fade, Be scattered around, and together be
        laid; And the young and the old, and the low and the high, Shall moulder
        to dust, and together shall lie. The infant a mother attended and loved;
        The mother that infant's affection who proved; The husband that mother
        and infant who blest,&mdash; Each, all, are away to their dwellings of
        rest. [The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye, Shone
        beauty and pleasure, her triumphs are by; And the memory of those who
        loved her and praised, Are alike from the minds of the living erased.]
        The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne, The brow of the priest
        that the mitre hath worn, The eye of the sage, and the heart of the
        brave, Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave. The peasant whose
        lot was to sow and to reap, The herdsman who climbed with his goats up
        the steep, The beggar who wandered in search of his bread, Have faded
        away like the grass that we tread. [The saint who enjoyed the communion
        of Heaven, The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven, The wise and the
        foolish, the guilty and just, Have quietly mingled their bones in the
        dust.] So the multitude goes, like the flower or the weed, That withers
        away to let others succeed; So the multitude comes, even those we
        behold, To repeat every tale that has often been told. For we are the
        same our fathers have been; We see the same sights our fathers have
        seen; We drink the same stream, we view the same sun, And run the same
        course our fathers have run. The thoughts we are thinking our fathers
        would think; From the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink;
        To the life we are clinging they also would cling; But it speeds from us
        all like a bird on the wing. They loved, but the story we cannot unfold;
        They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold; They grieved, but no
        wail from their slumber will come; They joyed, but the tongue of their
        gladness is dumb. They died, ay, they died: we things that are now, That
        walk on the turf that lies over their brow, And make in their dwellings
        a transient abode, Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage
        road. Yea, hope and despondency, pleasure and pain, Are mingled together
        in sunshine and rain; And the smile and the tear, the song and the
        dirge, Still follow each other like surge upon surge. 'Tis the wink of
        an eye,'tis the draught of a breath, From the blossom of health to the
        paleness of death, From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud,&mdash;
        Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?'"
      </p>

    <p>
      It was only a year or two after the death of Ann Rutledge that Mr. Lincoln
      told Robert L. Wilson, a distinguished colleague in the Legislature, parts
      of whose letter will be printed in another place, that, although "he
      appeared to enjoy life rapturously," it was a mistake; that, "when alone,
      he was so overcome by mental depression, that he never dared to carry a
      pocket-knife." And during all Mr. Wilson's extended acquaintance with him
      he never did own a knife, notwithstanding he was inordinately fond of
      whittling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Herndon says, "He never addressed another woman, in my opinion, 'Yours
      affectionately,' and generally and characteristically abstained from the
      use of the word '<i>love.</i>' That word cannot be found more than a
      half-dozen times, if that often, in all his letters and speeches since
      that time. I have seen some of his letters to other ladies, but he never
      says 'love.' He never ended his letters with 'Yours affectionately,' but
      signed his name, 'Your friend, A. Lincoln.'" After Mr. Lincoln's election
      to the Presidency, he one day met an old friend, Isaac Cogdale, who had
      known him intimately in the better days of the Rutledges at New Salem.
      "Ike," said he, "call at my office at the State House about an hour by
      sundown. The company will then all be gone." Cogdale went according to
      request; "and sure enough," as he expressed it, "the company dropped off
      one by one, including Lincoln's clerk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I want to inquire about old times and old acquaintances,' began Mr.
      Lincoln. 'When we lived in Salem, there were the Greenes, Potters,
      Armstrongs, and Rutledges. These folks have got scattered all over the
      world,&mdash;some are dead. Where are the Rutledges, Greenes, &amp;c.?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After we had spoken over old times," continues Cogdale,&mdash;"persons,
      circumstances,&mdash;in which he showed a wonderful memory, I then dared
      to ask him this question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'May I now, in turn, ask you one question, Lincoln?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Assuredly. I will answer your question, if a fair one, with all my
      heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, Abe, is it true that you fell in love and courted Ann Rutledge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is true,&mdash;true: indeed I did. I have loved the name of Rutledge
      to this day. I have kept my mind on their movements ever since, and love
      them dearly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Abe, is it true,'" still urged Cogdale, "that you ran a little wild
      about the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I did really. I ran off the track. It was my first. I loved the woman
      dearly. She was a handsome girl; would have made a good, loving wife; was
      natural and quite intellectual, though not highly educated. I did honestly
      and truly love the girl, and think often, often, of her now.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after the burial of Ann, McNamar returned to New Salem. He saw
      Lincoln at the post-office, and was struck with the deplorable change in
      his appearance. A short time afterwards Lincoln wrote him a deed, which he
      still has, and prizes highly, in memory of his great friend and rival. His
      father was at last dead; but he brought back with him his mother and her
      family. In December of the same year his mother died, and was buried in
      the same graveyard with Ann. During his absence, Col. Rutledge had
      occupied his farm, and there Ann died; but "the Rutledge farm" proper
      adjoined this one to the south. "Some of Mr. Lincoln's corners, as a
      surveyor, are still visible on lines traced by him on both farms."
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, the fourteenth day of October, 1866, William H. Herndon knocked
      at the door of John McNamar, at his residence, but a few feet distant from
      the spot where Ann Rutledge breathed her last. After some preliminaries
      not necessary to be related, Mr. Herndon says, "I asked him the question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Did you know Miss Rutledge? If so, where did she die?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sat by his open window, looking westerly; and, pulling me closer to
      himself, looked through the window and said, 'There, by that,'&mdash;choking
      up with emotion, pointing his long forefinger, nervous and trembling, to
      the spot,&mdash;'there, by that currant-bush, she died. The old house in
      which she and her father died is gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After further conversation, leaving the sadness to momentarily pass away,
      I asked this additional question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where was she buried?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In Concord burying-ground, one mile south-east of this place.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Herndon sought the grave. "S. C. Berry," says he, "James Short (the
      gentleman who purchased in Mr. Lincoln's compass and chain in 1834, under
      an execution against Lincoln, or Lincoln &amp; Berry, and gratuitously
      gave them back to Mr. Lincoln), James Miles, and myself were together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked Mr. Berry if he knew where Miss Rutledge was buried,&mdash;the
      place and exact surroundings. He replied, 'I do. The grave of Miss
      Rutledge lies just north of her brother's, David Rutledge, a young lawyer
      of great promise, who died in 1842, in his twenty-seventh year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cemetery contains but an acre of ground, in a beautiful and secluded
      situation. A thin skirt of timber lies on the east, commencing at the
      fence of the cemetery. The ribbon of timber, some fifty yards wide, hides
      the sun's early rise. At nine o'clock the sun pours all his rays into the
      cemetery. An extensive prairie lies west, the forest north, a field on the
      east, and timber and prairie on the south. In this lonely ground lie the
      Berrys, the Rutledges, the Clarys, the Armstrongs, and the Joneses, old
      and respected citizens,&mdash;pioneers of an early day. I write, or rather
      did write, the original draught of this description in the immediate
      presence of the ashes of Miss Ann Rutledge, the beautiful and tender dead.
      The village of the dead is a sad, solemn place. Its very presence imposes
      truth on the mind of the living writer. Ann Rutledge lies buried north of
      lier brother, and rests sweetly on his left arm, angels to guard her. The
      cemetery is fast filling with the hazel and the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      A lecture delivered by William H. Herndon at Springfield, in 1866,
      contained the main outline, without the minuter details, of the story here
      related. It was spoken, printed, and circulated without contradiction from
      any quarter. It was sent to the Rutledges, McNeeleys, Greenes, Short, and
      many other of the old residents of New Salem and Petersburg, with
      particular requests that they should correct any error they might find in
      it. It was pronounced by them all truthful and accurate; but their
      replies, together with a mass of additional evidence, have been carefully
      collated with the lecture, and the result is the present chapter. The
      story of Ann Rutledge, Lincoln, and McNamar, as told here, is as well
      proved as the fact of Mr. Lincoln's election to the Presidency.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOLLOWING strictly the chronological order hitherto observed in the course
      of this narrative, we should be compelled to break off the story of Mr.
      Lincoln's love-affairs at New Salem, and enter upon his public career in
      the Legislature and before the people. But, while by that means we should
      preserve continuity in one respect, we should lose it in another; and the
      reader would perhaps prefer to take in at one view all of Mr. Lincoln's
      courtships, save only that one which resulted in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three-quarters of a mile, or nearly so, north of Bowlin Greene's, and on
      the summit of a hill, stood the house of Bennett Able, a small frame
      building eighteen by twenty feet. Able and his wife were warm friends of
      Mr. Lincoln; and many of his rambles through the surrounding country,
      reading and talking to himself, terminated at their door, where he always
      found the latch-string on the outside, and a hearty welcome within. In
      October, 1833, Mr. Lincoln met there Miss Mary Owens, a sister of Mrs.
      Able, and, as we shall presently learn from his own words, admired her,
      although not extravagantly. She remained but four weeks, and then went
      back to her home in Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Owens's mother being dead, her father married again; and Miss Owens,
      for good reasons of her own, thought she would rather live with her sister
      than with her stepmother. Accordingly, in the fall of 1836, she
      re-appeared at Able's, passing through New Salem on the day of the
      presidential election, where the men standing about the polls stared and
      wondered at her "beauty." Twenty eight or nine years of age, "she was," in
      the language of Mr. L. M. Greene, "tall and portly; weighed about one
      hundred and twenty pounds, and had large blue eyes, with the finest
      trimmings I ever saw. She was jovial, social, loved wit and humor, had a
      liberal English education, and was considered wealthy. Bill," continues
      our excellent friend, "I am getting old; have seen too much trouble to
      give a lifelike picture of this woman. I won't try it. None of the poets
      or romance-writers has ever given to us a picture of a heroine so
      beautiful as a good description of Miss Owens in 1836 would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardin Bale, a cousin to Miss Owens, says "she was blue-eyed,
      dark-haired, handsome,&mdash;not pretty,&mdash;was rather large and tall,
      handsome, truly handsome, matronly looking, over ordinary size in height
      and weight.... Miss Owens was handsome, that is to say, noble-looking,
      matronly seeming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Respecting her age and looks, Miss. Owens herself makes the following
      note, Aug. 6, 1866:&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      "Born in the year eight; fair skin, deep-blue eyes, with dark curling
      hair; height five feet five inches, weighing about one hundred and fifty
      pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson G. Greene is Miss Owens's cousin; and, whilst on a visit to her in
      1866, he contrived to get her version of the Lincoln courtship at great
      length. It does not vary in any material part from the account currently
      received in the neighborhood, and given by various persons, whose oral or
      written testimony is preserved in Mr. Herndon's collection of manuscripts.
      Greene (J. G.) described her in terms about the same as those used by Mrs.
      Bale, adding that "she was a nervous and muscular woman," very
      "intellectual,"&mdash;"the most intellectual woman he ever saw,"&mdash;"with
      a forehead massive and angular, square, prominent, and broad."
    </p>
    <p>
      After Miss Owens's return to New Salem, in the fall of 1813, Mr. Lincoln
      was unremitting in his attentions; and wherever she went he was at her
      side. She had many relatives in the neighborhood,&mdash;the Bales, the
      Greenes, the Grahams: and, if she went to spend an afternoon or an evening
      with any of these, Abe was very likely to be on hand to conduct her home.
      He asked her to marry him; but she prudently evaded a positive answer
      until she could make up her mind about questionable points of his
      character. She did not think him coarse or cruel; but she did think him
      thoughtless, careless, not altogether as polite as he might be,&mdash;in
      short, "deficient," as she expresses it, "in those little links which make
      up the great chain of woman's happiness." His heart was good, his
      principles were high, his honor sensitive; but still, in the eyes of this
      refined, young lady, he did not seem to be quite the gentleman. "He was
      lacking in the smaller attentions;" and, in fact, the whole affair is
      explained when she tells us that "<i>his education was different from"
      hers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Miss Owens and Mrs. Bowlin Greene were making their way slowly and
      tediously up the hill to Able's house, when they were joined by Lincoln.
      Mrs. Bowlin Greene was carrying "a great big fat child, heavy, and crossly
      disposed." Although the woman bent pitiably under her burden, Lincoln
      offered her no assistance, but, dropping behind with Miss Owens, beguiled
      the way according to his wishes. When they reached the summit, "Miss Owens
      said to Lincoln laughingly, 'You would not make a good husband. Abe.' They
      sat on the fence; and one word brought on another, till a split or breach
      ensued."
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after this misunderstanding, Lincoln went off toward Havana on
      a surveying expedition, and was absent about three weeks. On the first day
      of his return, one of Able's boys was sent up "to town" for the mail.
      Lincoln saw him at the post-office, and "asked if Miss Owens was at Mr.
      Able's." The boy said "Yes."&mdash;"Tell her," said Lin-join, "that I'll
      be down to see her in a few minutes." Now, Miss Owens had determined to
      spend that evening at Minter Graham's; and when the boy gave in the
      report, "she thought a moment, and said to herself, 'If I can draw Lincoln
      up there to Graham's, it will be all right.'" This scheme was to operate
      as a test of Abe's love; but it shared the fate of some of "the best-laid
      schemes of mice and men," and went "all agley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln, according to promise, went down to Able's, and asked if Miss
      Owens was in. Mrs. Able replied that she had gone to Graham's, about one
      and a half miles from Able's due south-west. Lincoln said, "Didn't she
      know I was coming?" Mrs. Able answered, "No;" but one of the children
      said, "Yes, ma, she did, for I heard Sam tell her so." Lincoln sat a
      while, and then went about his business. "The fat was now in the fire.
      Lincoln thought, as he was extremely poor, and Miss Owens very rich, it
      was a fling on him on that account. Abe was mistaken in his guesses, for
      wealth cut no figure in Miss Owens's eyes. Miss Owens regretted her
      course. Abe would not bend; and Miss Owens wouldn't. She said, if she had
      it to do over again she would play the cards differently.... She had two
      sons in the Southern army. She said that if either of them had got into
      difficulty, she would willingly have gone to old Abe for relief."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Miss Owens's letter of July 22, 1866, it will be observed! that she
      tacitly admitted to Mr. Gaines Greene "the circumstances in connection
      with Mrs. Greene and child." Although she here denies the precise words
      alleged to have been used by her in the little quarrel at the top of the
      hill, she does not deny the impression his conduct left upon her mind, but
      presents additional evidence of it by the relation of another incident of
      similar character, from which her inferences were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately we are not compelled, to rely upon tradition, however
      authentic, for the facts concerning this interesting episode in Mr.
      Lincoln's life. Miss Owens is still alive to tell her own tale, and we
      have besides his letters to the lady herself. Mr. Lincoln wrote his
      account of it as early as 1838. As in duty bound, we shall permit the lady
      to speak first. At her particular request, her present name and residence
      are suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, May 1, 1866.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. H. Herndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;After quite a struggle with my feelings, I have at last
      decided to send you the letters in my possession written by Mr. Lincoln,
      believing, as I do, that you are a gentleman of honor, and will faithfully
      abide by all you have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My associations with your lamented friend were in Menard County, whilst
      visiting a sister, who then resided near Petersburg. I have learned that
      my maiden name is now in your possession; and you have ere this, no doubt,
      been informed that I am a native Kentuckian.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards Miss Rutledge, I cannot tell you any thing, she having died
      previous to my acquaintance with Mr. Lincoln; and I do not now recollect
      of ever hearing him mention her name. Please return the letters at your
      earliest convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very respectfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary S.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, May 22,1866.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. H. Herndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;Really you catechise me in true lawyer style; but I
      feel you will have the goodness to excuse me if I decline answering all
      your questions in detail, being well assured that few women would have
      ceded as much as I have under all the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say you have heard why our acquaintance terminated as it did. I, too,
      have heard the same bit of gossip; but I never used the remark which Madam
      Rumor says I did to Mr. Lincoln. I think I did on one occasion say to my
      sister, who was very anxious for us to be married, that I thought Mr.
      Lincoln was deficient in those little links which make up the chain of
      woman's happiness,&mdash;at least, it was so in my case. Not that I
      believed it proceeded from a lack of goodness of heart: but his training
      had been different from mine; hence there was not that congeniality which
      would otherwise have existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his own showing, you perceive that his heart and hand were at my
      disposal; and I suppose that my feelings were not sufficiently enlisted to
      have the matter consummated. About the beginning of the year 1833 I left
      Illinois, at which time our acquaintance and correspondence ceased without
      ever again being renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, who resided in Green County, Kentucky, was a gentleman of
      considerable means; and I am persuaded that few persons placed a higher
      estimate on education than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mart S.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, July 22, 1866.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. H. Herndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;I do not think that you are pertinacious in asking the
      question relative to old Mrs. Bowlin Greene, because I wish to set you
      right on that question. Your information, no doubt, came through my
      cousin, Mr. Gaines Greene, who visited us last winter. Whilst here, he was
      laughing at me about Mr. Lincoln, and among other things spoke about the
      circumstance in connection with Mrs. Greene and child. My impression is
      now that I tacitly admitted it, for it was a season of trouble with me,
      and I gave but little heed to the matter. We never had any hard feelings
      toward each other that I know of. On no occasion did I say to Mr. Lincoln
      that I did not believe he would make a kind husband, because he did not
      tender his services to Mrs. Greene in helping of her carry her babe. As I
      said to you in a former letter, I thought him lacking in smaller
      attentions. One circumstance presents itself just now to my mind's eye.
      There was a company of us going to Uncle Billy Greene's. Mr. Lincoln was
      riding with me; and we had a very bad branch to cross. The other gentlemen
      were very officious in seeing that their partners got over safely. We were
      behind, he riding in, never looking back to see how I got along. When I
      rode up beside him, I remarked, "You are a nice fellow! I suppose you did
      not care whether my neck was broken or not." He laughingly replied (I
      suppose by way of compliment) that he knew I was plenty smart to take care
      of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many things he was sensitive, almost to a fault. He told me of an
      incident: that he was crossing a prairie one day, and saw before him "a
      hog mired down," to use his own language. He was rather "fixed up;" and he
      resolved that he would pass on without looking towards the shoat. After he
      had gone by, he said the feeling was irresistible; and he had to look
      back, and the poor thing seemed to say wistfully, "There, now, my last
      hope is gone;" that he deliberately got down, and relieved it from its
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many things we were congenial spirits. In politics we saw eye to eye,
      though since then we differed as widely as the South is from the North.
      But methinks I hear you say, "Save me from a political woman!" So say I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last message I ever received from him was about a year after we parted
      in Illinois. Mrs. Able visited Kentucky; and he said to her in
      Springfield, "Tell your sister that I think she was a great fool, because
      she did not stay here, and marry me." Characteristic of the man.

    <p>
      Mary,&mdash;I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I should have
      written sooner. It is but little difference, however, as I have very
      little even yet to write. And more, the longer I can avoid the
      mortification of looking in the post-office for your letter, and not
      finding it, the better. You see I am mad about that <i>old letter</i> yet.
      I don't like very well to risk you again. I'll try you once more, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new State House is not yet finished, and consequently the Legislature
      is doing little or nothing. The Governor delivered an inflammatory
      political message, and it is expected there will be some sparring between
      the parties about it as soon as the two Houses get to business. Taylor
      delivered up his petitions for the new county to one of our members this
      morning. I am told he despairs of its success, on account of all the
      members from Morgan County opposing it. There are names enough on the
      petition, I think, to justify the members from our county in going for it;
      but if the members from Morgan oppose it, which they say they will, the
      chance will be bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our chance to take the seat of government to Springfield is better than I
      expected. An internal-improvement convention was held here since we met,
      which recommended a loan of several million of dollars, on the faith of
      the State, to construct railroads. Some of the Legislature are for it, and
      some against it: which has the majority I cannot tell. There is great
      strife and struggling for the office of the United States Senator here at
      this time. It is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days. The
      opposition men have no candidate of their own; and consequently they will
      smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the contending Van-Buren
      candidates and their respective friends, as the Christian does at Satan's
      rage. You recollect that I mentioned at the outset of this letter that I
      had been unwell. That is the fact, though I believe I am about well now;
      but that, with other things I cannot account for, have conspired, and have
      gotten my spirits so low that I feel that I would rather be any place in
      the world than here. I really cannot endure the thought of staying here
      ten weeks. Write back as soon as you get this, and, if possible, say
      something that will please me; for really I have not been pleased since I
      left you. This letter is so dry and stupid that I am ashamed to send it,
      but with my present feelings I cannot do any better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give my best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Able and family.

    </p>
    <p>
      Friend Mary,&mdash;I have commenced two letters to send you before this,
      both of which displeased me before I got half done, and so I tore them up.
      The first I thought was not serious enough, and the second was on the
      other extreme. I shall send this, turn out as it may.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business, after all;
      at least, it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome here as I ever was
      anywhere in my life. I have been spoken to by but one woman since I've
      been here, and should not have been by her, if she could have avoided it.
      I've never been to church yet, nor probably shall not be soon. I stay away
      because I am conscious I should not know how to behave myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am often thinking about what we said of your coming to live at
      Springfield. I am afraid you would not be satisfied. There is a great deal
      of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom to see
      without sharing it. You would have to be poor, without the means of hiding
      your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently? Whatever woman
      may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is my intention to
      do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and there is nothing I
      can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort. I
      know I should be much happier with you than the way I am, provided I saw
      no signs of discontent in you. What you have said to me may have been in
      the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood it. If so, then let it be
      forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you would think seriously before you
      decide. For my part, I have already decided. What I have said I will most
      positively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is, that you had
      better not do it. You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may be
      more severe than you now imagine. I know you are capable of thinking
      correctly on any subject; and, if you deliberate maturely upon this before
      you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must write me a good long letter after you get this. You have nothing
      else to do; and, though it might not seem interesting to you after you
      have written it, it would be a good deal of company to me in this "busy
      wilderness." Tell your sister, I don't want to hear any more about selling
      out and moving, That gives me the hypo whenever I think of it.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Friend Mary,&mdash;You will no doubt think it rather strange that I should
      write you a letter on the same day on which we parted; and I can only
      account for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you
      more than usual; while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of
      thoughts. You must know that I cannot see you, or think of you, with
      entire indifference; and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard to
      what my real feelings toward you are. If I knew you were not, I should not
      trouble you with this letter. Perhaps any other man would know enough
      without further information; but I consider it my peculiar right to plead
      ignorance, and your bounden duty to allow the plea. I want in all cases to
      do right; and most particularly so in all cases with women. I want, at
      this particular time, more than any thing else, to do right with you: and
      if I knew it would be doing right, as I rather suspect it would, to let
      you alone, I would do it. And, for the purpose of making the matter as
      plain as possible, I now say that you can now drop the subject, dismiss
      your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me forever, and leave this letter
      unanswered, without calling forth one accusing murmur from me. And I will
      even go further, and say, that, if it will add any thing to your comfort
      or peace of mind to do so, it is my sincere wish that you should. Do not
      understand by this that I wish to cut your acquaintance. I mean no such
      thing. What I do wish is, that our further acquaintance shall depend upon
      yourself. If such further acquaintance would constitute nothing to your
      happiness, I am sure it would not to mine. If you feel yourself in any
      degree bound to me, I am now willing to release you, provided you wish it;
      while, on the other hand, I am willing, and even anxious, to bind you
      faster, if I can be convinced that it will, in any considerable degree,
      add to your happiness. This, indeed, is the whole question with me.
      Nothing would make me more miserable than to believe you miserable,&mdash;nothing
      more happy than to know you were so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make
      myself understood is the only object of this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it suits you best to not answer this, farewell. A long life and a merry
      one attend you. But, if you conclude to write back, speak as plainly as I
      do. There can be neither harm nor danger in saying to me any thing you
      think, just in the manner you think it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My respects to your sister. Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his second meeting with Mary, Mr. Lincoln had little time to
      prosecute his addresses in person; for early in December he was called
      away to his seat in the Legislature; but, if his tongue was silent in the
      cause, his pen was busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the session of the Legislature of 1886-7, Mr. Lincoln made the
      acquaintance of Mrs. O. H. Browning, whose husband was also a member. The
      acquaintance ripened into friendship, and that winter and the next Mr.
      Lincoln spent a great deal of time in social intercourse with the
      Brownings. Mrs. Browning knew nothing as yet of the affair with Miss
      Owens; but as the latter progressed, and Lincoln became more and more
      involved, she noticed the ebb of his spirits, and often rallied him as the
      victim of some secret but consuming passion. With this for his excuse,
      Lincoln wrote her, after the adjournment of the Legislature, a full and
      connected account of the manner in which he had latterly been making "a
      fool of" himself. For many reasons the publication of this letter is an
      extremely painful duty. If it could be withheld, and the act decently
      reconciled to the conscience of a biographer professing to be honest and
      candid, it should never see the light in these pages. Its grotesque humor,
      its coarse exaggerations in describing the person of a lady whom the
      writer was willing to marry, its imputation of toothless and weatherbeaten
      old age to a woman really young and handsome, its utter lack of that
      delicacy of tone and sentiment which one naturally expects a gentleman to
      adopt when he thinks proper to discuss the merits of his late mistress,&mdash;all
      these, and its defective orthography, it would certainly be more agreeable
      to suppress than to publish. But, if we begin by omitting or mutilating a
      document which sheds so broad a light upon one part of his life and one
      phase of his character, why may we not do the like as fast and as often as
      the temptations arise? and where shall the process cease? A biography
      worth writing at all is worth writing fully and honestly; and the writer
      who suppresses or mangles the truth is no better than he who bears false
      witness in any other capacity. In April, 1838, Miss Owens finally departed
      from Illinois; and in that same month Mr. Lincoln wrote Mrs. Browning:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, April 1, 1838.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Madam,&mdash;Without appologising for being egotistical, I shall make
      the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the
      subject of this letter. And, by the way, I now discover, that, in order to
      give a full and inteligible account of the things I have done and suffered
      since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, then, in the autumn of 1836, that a married lady of my
      acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a
      visit to her father &amp; other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed
      to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on
      condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all
      convenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know I
      could not have done otherwise, had I really been averse to it; but
      privately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with
      the project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought
      her inteligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding life
      through hand in hand with her. Time passed on, the lady took her journey,
      and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This astonished
      me a little; for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that
      she was a trifle too willing; but, on reflection, it occurred to me that
      she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come, without
      any thing concerning me ever having been mentioned to her; and so I
      concluded, that, if no other objection presented itself, I would consent
      to wave this. All this occurred to me on <i>hearing</i> of her arrival in
      the neighborhood; for, be it remembered, I had not yet <i>seen</i> her,
      except about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we
      had an interview; and, although I had seen her before, she did not look as
      my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was oversize, but she now
      appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an "old maid,"
      and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appelation; but
      now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid thinking of my
      mother; and this, not from withered features, for her skin was too full of
      fat 'to permit of its contracting into wrinkles, but from her want of
      teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a kind of notion
      that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of
      infancy and reached her present bulk in less than thirty-five or forty
      years; and, in short, I was not at all pleased with her. But what could I
      do? I had told her sister that I would take her for better or for worse;
      and I made a point of honor and conscience in all things to stick to my
      word, especially if others had been induced to act on it, which in this
      case I had no doubt they had; for I was now fairly convinced that no other
      man on earth would have her, and hence the conclusion that they were bent
      on holding me to my bargain. "Well," thought I, "I have said it, and, be
      the consequences what they may, it shall not be my fault if I fail to do
      it." At once I determined to consider her my wife; and, this done, all my
      powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which
      might be fairly sett off against her defects. I tried to imagine her
      handsome, which, but for her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true.
      Exclusive of this, no woman that I have ever seen has a finer face. I also
      tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the
      person; and in this she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with
      whom I had been acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this, without attempting to come to any positive
      understanding with her, I sat out for Vandalia, when and where you first
      saw me. During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change
      my opinion of either her intelect or intention, but, on the contrary,
      confirmed it in both.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while, although I was fixed, "firm as the surge-repelling rock,"
      in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the rashness which
      had led me to make it. Through life, I have been in no bondage, either
      real or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to be
      free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my opinions of her in
      any particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now spent my time in
      planing how I might get along through life after my contemplated change of
      circumstances should have taken place, and how I might procrastinate the
      evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much, perhaps more, than an
      Irishman does the halter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all my suffering upon this deeply-interesting subject, here I am,
      wholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of the "scrape;" and I now want to
      know if you can guess how I got out of it,&mdash;out, clear, in every
      sense of the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don't
      believe you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the
      lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had
      delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the
      way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well
      bring it to a consumation without further delay; and so I mustered my
      resolution, and made the proposal to her direct: but, shocking to relate,
      she answered, No, At first I supposed she did it through an affectation of
      modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar
      circumstances of her case; but, on my renewal of the charge, I found she
      repeled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it again and again,
      but with the same success, or rather with the same want of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finally was forced to give it up; at which I verry unexpectedly found
      myself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed to
      me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the
      reflection that I had so long been too stupid to discover her intentions,
      and at the same time never doubting that I understood them perfectly; and
      also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have,
      had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to cap the
      whole, I then, for the first time, began to suspect that I was really a
      little in love with her. But let it all go. I'll try and outlive it.
      Others have been made fools of by the girls; but this can never with truth
      be said of me. I most emphatically, in this instance, made a fool of
      myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to think of
      marrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisfied with any one who
      would be blockhead enough to have me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.
      Give my respects to Mr. Browning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE majority of Mr. Lincoln's biographers&mdash;and they are many and
      credulous&mdash;tell us that he <i>walked</i> from New Salem to Vandalia,
      a distance of one hundred miles, to take his seat, for the first time, in
      the Legislature of the State. But that is an innocent mistake; for he was
      resolved to appear with as much of the dignity of the senator as his
      circumstances would permit. It was for this very purpose that he had
      borrowed the two hundred dollars from Coleman Smoot; and, when the choice
      between riding and walking presented itself, he sensibly enough got into
      the stage, with his new clothes on, and rode to the scene of his labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived there, he found a singular state of affairs. Duncan had
      been chosen Governor at the recent August election by "the whole-hog
      Jackson men;" but he was absent in Congress during the whole of the
      campaign; and, now that he came to the duties of his office, it was
      discovered that he had been all the while an anti-Jackson man, and was
      quite willing to aid the Whigs in furtherance of some of their worst
      schemes. These schemes were then just beginning to be hatched in great
      numbers; but in due time they were enacted into laws, and prepared
      Illinois with the proper weights of public debt and "rag" currency, to
      sink her deeper than her neighbors into the miseries of financial ruin in
      1837. The speculating fever was just reaching Illinois; the land and
      town-lot business had barely taken shape at Chicago; and State banks and
      multitudinous internal improvements were yet to be invented. But this
      Legislature was a very wise one in its own conceit, and was not slow to
      launch out with the first of a series of magnificent experiments. It
      contented itself, however, with chartering a State bank, with a capital of
      one million five hundred thousand dollars; rechartering, with a capital of
      three hundred thousand dollars, the Shawneetown Bank, which had broken
      twelve years before; and providing for a loan of five hundred thousand
      dollars, on the credit of the State, wherewith to make a beginning on the
      Illinois and Michigan Canal. The bill for the latter project was drawn and
      introduced by Senator James M. Strode, the gentleman who described with
      such moving eloquence the horrors of Stillman's defeat. These measures
      Gov. Ford considers "the beginning of all the bad legislation which
      followed in a few years, and which, as is well known, resulted in general
      ruin." Mr. Lincoln favored them all, and faithfully followed out the
      policy of which they were the inauguration at subsequent sessions of the
      same body. For the present, nevertheless, he was a silent member, although
      he was assigned a prominent place on the Committee on Public Accounts and
      Expenditures. The bank-charters were drawn by a Democrat who hoped to find
      his account in the issue; all the bills were passed by a Legislature
      "nominally" Democratic; but the Board of Canal Commissioners was composed
      exclusively of Whigs, and the Whigs straightway assumed control of the
      banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at a special session of this Legislature that Lincoln first saw
      Stephen A. Douglas, and, viewing his active little person with immense
      amusement, pronounced him "the <i>least</i> man he ever saw." Douglas had
      come into the State (from Vermont) only the previous year, but, having
      studied law for several months, considered himself eminently qualified to
      be State's attorney for the district in which he lived, and was now come
      to Vandalia for that purpose. The place was already filled by a man of
      considerable distinction; but the incumbent remaining at home, possibly in
      blissful ignorance of his neighbor's design, was easily supplanted by the
      supple Vermonter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the misfortune of legislatures in general, as it was in those days
      the peculiar misfortune of the Legislature of Illinois, to be beset by a
      multitude of gentlemen engaged in the exclusive business of "log-rolling."
      Chief among the "rollers" were some of the most "distinguished" members,
      each assisted by an influential delegation from the district, bank, or
      "institution" to be benefited by the legislation proposed. An expert
      "log-roller," an especially wily and persuasive person, who could depict
      the merits of his scheme with roseate but delusive eloquence, was said to
      carry "a gourd of possum fat," and the unhappy victim of his art was said
      to be "<i>greased and swallowed</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be supposed that anybody ever succeeded in anointing a single
      square inch of Mr. Lincoln's person with the "fat" that deluded; but
      historians aver that "the Long Nine," of whom he was the longest and
      cleverest, possessed "gourds" of extraordinary dimensions, and distributed
      "grease" of marvellous virtues. But of that at another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1836 Mr. Lincoln was again a candidate for the Legislature; his
      colleagues on the Whig ticket in Sangamon being, for Representatives, John
      Dawson, William F. Elkin, N. W. Edwards, Andrew McCormick, Dan Stone, and
      R. L. Wilson; and for Senators, A. G. Herndon and Job Fletcher. They were
      all elected but one, and he was beaten by John Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln opened the campaign by the following manifesto:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      New Salem, June 13, 1836.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Editor of "The Journal."
    </p>
    <p>
      In your paper of last Saturday, I see a communication over the signature
      of "Many Voters," in which the candidates who are announced in the
      "Journal" are called upon to "show their hands." Agreed. Here's mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in
      bearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for admitting all <i>whites</i> to
      the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (<i>by no means excluding
      females</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my constituents,
      as well those that oppose as those that support me.
    </p>
    <p>
      While acting as their Representative, I shall be governed by their will on
      all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will is;
      and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best
      advance their interests. Whether elected or not, I go for distributing the
      proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several States, to enable
      our State, in common with others, to dig canals and construct railroads
      without borrowing money and paying the interest on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote for Hugh L.
      White for President.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Very respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elections were held on the first Monday in August, and the campaign
      began about six weeks or two months before. Popular meetings were
      advertised in "The Sangamon Journal" and "The State Register,"&mdash;organs
      of the respective parties. Not unfrequently the meetings were joint,
      &mdash;composed of both parties,&mdash;when, as Lincoln would say, the
      candidates "put in their best licks," while the audience "rose to the
      height of the great argument" with cheers, taunts, cat-calls, fights, and
      other exercises appropriate to the free and untrammelled enjoyment of the
      freeman's boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candidates travelled from one grove to another on horseback; and, when
      the "Long Nine" (all over six feet in height) took the road, it must have
      been a goodly sight to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard Lincoln make a speech," says James Gourly, "in Mechanicsburg,
      Sangamon County, in 1836. John Neal had a fight at the time: the roughs
      got on him, and Lincoln jumped in and saw fair play. We staid for dinner
      at Green's, close to Mechanicsburg,&mdash;drank whiskey sweetened with
      honey. There the questions discussed were internal improvements, Whig
      principles." (Gourly was a great friend of Lincoln's, for Gourly had had a
      foot-race "with H. B. Truett, now of California," and Lincoln had been his
      "judge;" and it was a remarkable circumstance, that nearly everybody for
      whom Lincoln "judged" came out ahead.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard Mr. Lincoln during the same canvass," continues Gourly. "It was
      at the Court House, where the State House now stands. The Whigs and
      Democrats had a general quarrel then and there. N. W. Edwards drew a
      pistol on Achilles Morris." But Gourly's account of this last scene is
      unsatisfactory, although the witness is willing; and we turn to Lincoln's
      colleague, Mr. Wilson, for a better one. "The Saturday evening preceding
      the election the candidates were addressing the people in the Court House
      at Springfield. Dr. Early, one of the candidates on the Democratic side,
      made some charge that N. W. Edwards, one of the candidates on the Whig
      side, deemed untrue. Edwards climbed on a table, so as to be seen by
      Early, and by every one in the house, and at the top of his voice told
      Early that the charge was false. The excitement that followed was intense,&mdash;so
      much so, that fighting men thought that a duel must settle the difficulty.
      Mr. Lincoln, by the programme, followed Early. He took up the subject in
      dispute, and handled it fairly, and with such ability that every one was
      astonished and pleased. So that difficulty ended there. Then, for the
      first time, developed by the excitement of the occasion, he spoke in that
      tenor intonation of voice that ultimately settled down into that clear,
      shrill monotone style of speaking that enabled his audience, however
      large, to hear distinctly the lowest sound of his voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during this campaign, possibly at the same meeting, that Mr. Speed
      heard him reply to George Forquer. Forquer had been a leading Whig, one of
      their foremost men in the Legislature of 1834, but had then recently
      changed sides, and thereupon was appointed Register of the Land Office at
      Springfield. Mr. Forquer was an astonishing man: he not only astonished
      the people by "changing his coat in politics," but by building the best
      frame-house in Springfield, and erecting over it the only lightning-rod
      the entire region could boast of. At this meeting he listened attentively
      to Mr. Lincoln's first speech, and was much annoyed by the transcendent
      power with which the awkward young man defended the principles he had
      himself so lately abandoned. "The speech" produced a profound impression,
      "especially upon a large number of Lincoln's friends and admirers, who had
      come in from the country" expressly to hear and applaud him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the conclusion of Lincoln's speech" (we quote from Mr. Speed), "the
      crowd was dispersing, when Forquer rose and asked to be heard. He
      commenced by saying that the young man would have to be taken down, and
      was sorry that the task devolved upon him. He then proceeded to answer
      Lincoln's speech in a style, which, while it was able and fair, yet, in
      his whole manner, asserted and claimed superiority. Lincoln stood near
      him, and watched him during the whole of his speech. When Forquer
      concluded, he took the stand again. I have often heard him since, in court
      and before the people, but never saw him appear so well as upon that
      occasion. He replied to Mr. Forquer with great dignity and force; but I
      shall never forget the conclusion of that speech. Turning to Mr. Forquer,
      he said, that he had commenced his speech by announcing that 'this young
      man would have to be taken down.' Turning then to the crowd, he said, 'It
      is for you, not for me, to say whether I am up or down. The gentleman has
      alluded to my being a young man: I am older in years than I am in the
      tricks and trades of politicians. I desire to live, and I desire place and
      distinction as a politician; but I would rather die now, than, like the
      gentleman, live to see the day that I would have to erect a lightning-rod
      to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He afterwards told Speed that the sight of that same rod "had led him to
      the study of the properties of electricity and the utility of the rod as a
      conductor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Democratic orators stumping the county at this time was Dick
      Taylor, a pompous gentleman, who went abroad in superb attire, ruffled
      shirts, rich vest, and immense watch-chains, with shining and splendid
      pendants. But Dick was a severe Democrat in theory, made much of "the
      hard-handed yeomanry," and flung many biting sarcasms upon the
      aristocratic pretensions of the Whigs,&mdash;the "rag barons" and the
      manufacturing "lords." He was one day in the midst of a particularly
      aggravating declamation of this sort, "when Abe began to feel devilish,
      and thought he would take the wind out of Dick's sails by a little sport."
      He therefore "edged" slyly up to the speaker, and suddenly catching his
      vest by the lower corner, and giving it a sharp pull upward, it opened
      wide, and out fell upon the platform, in full view of the astonished
      audience, a mass of ruffled shirt, gold watch, chains, seals, and
      glittering jewels. Jim Matheny was there, and nearly broke his heart with
      mirth. "The crowd couldn't stand it, but shouted uproariously." It must
      have been then that Abe delivered the following speech, although Ninian W.
      Edwards places it in 1840:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "While he [Col. Taylor] was making these charges against the Whigs over
      the country, riding in fine carriages, wearing ruffled shirts, kid gloves,
      massive gold watch-chains, with large gold seals, and flourishing a heavy
      gold-headed cane, he [Lincoln] was a poor boy, hired on a flatboat at
      eight dollars a month, and had only one pair of breeches to his back, and
      they were buckskin,&mdash;'and,' said Lincoln, 'if you know the nature of
      buckskin, when wet and dried by the sun, they will shrink,&mdash;and mine
      kept shrinking, until they left several inches of my legs bare between the
      tops of my socks and the lower part of my breeches; and, whilst I was
      growing taller, they were becoming shorter, and so much tighter, that they
      left a blue streak around my legs that can be seen to this day. If you
      call this aristocracy, I plead guilty to the charge.'" Hitherto Sangamon
      County had been uniformly Democratic; but at this election the Whigs
      carried it by an average majority of about four hundred, Mr. Lincoln
      receiving a larger vote than any other candidate. The result was in part
      due to a transitory and abortive attempt of the anti-Jackson and
      anti-Van-Buren men to build up a third party, with Judge White of
      Tennessee as its leader. This party was not supposed to be wedded to the
      "specie circular," was thought to be open to conviction on the bank
      question, clamored loudly about the business interests and general
      distress of the country, and was actually in favor of the distribution of
      the proceeds of the sales of the public lands. In the nomenclature of
      Illinois, its members might have been called "nominal Jackson men;" that
      is to say, men who continued to act with the Democratic party, while
      disavowing its cardinal principles,&mdash;traders, trimmers, cautious
      schismatics who argued the cause of Democracy from a brief furnished by
      the enemy. The diversion in favor of White was just to the hand of the
      Whigs, and they aided it in every practicable way. Always for an expedient
      when an expedient would answer, a compromise when a compromise would do,
      the "hand" Mr. Lincoln "showed" at the opening of the campaign contained
      the "White" card among the highest of its trumps. "If alive on the first
      Monday in November, I shall vote for Hugh L. White for President." A
      number of local Democratic politicians assisting him to play it, it won
      the game in 1836, and Sangamon County went over to the Whigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this election Mr. Douglas was made a Representative from Morgan County,
      along with Col. Hardin, from whom he had the year before taken the State's
      attorneyship. The event is notable principally because Mr. Douglas was
      nominated by a convention, and not by the old system of self-announcement,
      which, under the influence of Eastern immigrants, like himself, full of
      party zeal, and attached to the customs of the places whence they came,
      was gradually but surely falling into disfavor. Mr. Douglas served only
      one session, and then became Register of the Land Office at Springfield.
      The next year he was nominated for Congress in the Peoria District, under
      the convention system, and in the same year Col. Stephenson was nominated
      for Governor in the same way. The Whigs were soon compelled to adopt the
      device which they saw marshalling the Democrats in a state of complete
      discipline; whilst they themselves were disorganized by a host of
      volunteer candidates and the operations of innumerable cliques and
      factions. At first "it was considered a Yankee contrivance," intended to
      abridge the liberties of the people; but the Whig "people" were as fond of
      victory, offices, and power as their enemies were, and in due time they
      took very kindly to this effectual means of gaining them. A speech of
      Ebenezer Peck of Chicago, "before a great meeting of the lobby, during the
      special session of 1835-6 at Vandalia," being a production of special
      ingenuity and power, is supposed to have contributed largely to the
      introduction of the convention system into the middle and southern parts
      of the State. Mr. Peck was then a fervent Democrat, whom the Whigs
      delighted to malign as a Canadian monarchist; but in after times he was
      the fast and able friend of their great leader, Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first and worst effects of the stricter organization of parties
      in Illinois, as well as in other States, was the strong diversion of
      public attention from State to Federal affairs. Individual candidates were
      no longer required to "show their hands:" they accepted "platforms" when
      they accepted nominations; and without a nomination it was mere quixotism
      to stand at all. District, State, and national conventions, acting and
      re-acting upon one another, produced a concert of sentiment and conduct
      which overlaid local issues, and repressed independent proceedings. This
      improved party machinery supplied the readiest and most effective means of
      distributing the rapidly-increasing patronage of the Federal Executive;
      and those who did not wish to be cut off from its enjoyment could do no
      less than re-affirm with becoming fervor, in their local assemblages, the
      latest deliverance of the faith by the central authority. The promoters of
      heresies and schisms, the blind leaders who misled a county or a State
      convention, and seduced it into the declaration of principles of its own,
      had their seats contested in the next general council of the party, were
      solemnly sat upon, condemned, "delivered over to Satan to be buffeted,"
      and cast out of the household of faith, to wander in the wilderness and to
      live upon husks. It was like a feeble African bishop imputing heresy to
      the Christian world, with Rome at its head. A man like Mr. Lincoln, who
      earnestly "desired place and distinction as a politician," labored without
      hope while his party affinities remained the subject of a reasonable
      doubt. He must be "a whole-hog man" or nothing, a Whig or a Democrat. Mr.
      Lincoln chose his company with commendable decision, and wasted no tender
      regrets upon his "nominal" Democratic friends. For White against Harrison,
      in November, 1836, he led the Whigs into action when the Legislature met
      in December; and when the hard-cider campaign of 1840 commenced, with its
      endless meetings and processions, its coon-skins and log-cabins, its
      intrigue, trickery, and fun, his musical voice rose loudest above the din
      for "Old Tippecanoe;" and no man did better service, or enjoyed those
      memorable scenes more, than he who was to be the beneficiary of a similar
      revival in 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this legislature met in the winter of 1836-7, the bank and
      internal-improvement infatuation had taken full possession of a majority
      of the people, as well as of the politicians. To be sure, "Old Hickory"
      had given a temporary check to the wild speculations in Western land by
      the specie circular, about the close of his administration, whereby gold
      and silver were made "land-office money;" and the Government declined to
      exchange any more of the public domain for the depreciated paper of rotten
      and explosive banks. Millions of notes loaned by the banks on insufficient
      security or no security at all were by this timely measure turned back
      into the banks, or converted to the uses of a more legitimate and less
      dangerous business. But, even if the specie circular had not been
      repealed, it would probably have proved impotent against the evils it was
      designed to prevent, after the passage of the Act distributing among the
      States the surplus (or supposed surplus) revenues of the Federal
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last dollar of the old debt was paid in 1833. There were from time to
      time large unexpended and unappropriated balances in the treasury. What
      should be done with them? There was no sub-treasury as yet, and questions
      concerning the mere safe-keeping of these moneys excited the most
      tremendous political contests. The United States Bank had always had the
      use of the cash in the treasury in the form of deposits; but the bank
      abused its trust,&mdash;used its enormous power over the currency and
      exchanges of the country to achieve political results in its own interest,
      and, by its manifold sins and iniquities, compelled Gen. Jackson to remove
      the deposits. Ultimately the bank took shelter in Pennsylvania, where it
      began a new fraudulent life under a surreptitious clause tacked to the end
      of a road law on its passage through the General Assembly. In due time the
      "beast," as Col. Benton loved to call it, died in its chosen lair a
      shameful and ignominious death, cheating the public with a show of
      solvency to the end, and leaving a fine array of bill-holders and
      depositors to mourn one of the most remarkable delusions of modern times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withdrawn, or rather withheld (for they were never withdrawn), from the
      Bank of the United States, the revenues of the Federal Government were
      deposited as fast as they accrued in specie-paying State banks. They were
      paid in the notes of the thousand banks, good, bad, and indifferent, whose
      promises to pay constituted the paper currency of the day. It was this
      money which the Whigs, aided by Democratic recusants, proposed to give
      away to the States. They passed an Act requiring it to be <i>deposited</i>
      with the States,&mdash;ostensibly as a safe and convenient method of
      keeping it; but nobody believed that it would ever be called for, or paid
      if it was. It was simply an extraordinary largess; and pending the very
      embarrassment caused by itself, when the government had not a dollar
      wherewith to pay even a pension, and the temporary expedient was an issue
      of treasury notes against the better judgment of the party in power, the
      possibility of withdrawing these deposits was never taken into the
      account. The Act went into effect on the 1st of January, 1837, and was one
      of the immediate causes of the suspension and disasters of that year. "The
      condition of our deposit banks was desperate,&mdash;wholly inadequate to
      the slightest pressure on their vaults in the ordinary course of business,
      much less that of meeting the daily government drafts and the approaching
      deposit of near forty millions with the States." Nevertheless, the
      deposits began at the rate of ten millions to the quarter. The deposit
      banks "blew up;" and all the others, including that of the United States,
      closed their doors to customers and bill-holders, which gave them more
      time to hold public meetings, imputing the distress of the country to the
      hard-money policy of Jackson and Van Buren, and agitating for the
      re-charter of Mr. Biddle's profligate concern as the only remedy human
      ingenuity could devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the month previous to the first deposit with the States,&mdash;about
      the time when Gov. Ford says, "lands and town-lots were the only articles
      of export" from Illinois; when the counters of Western land-offices were
      piled high with illusory bank-notes in exchange for public lands, and when
      it was believed that the West was now at last about to bound forward in a
      career of unexampled prosperity, under the forcing process of public
      improvements by the States, with the aid and countenance of the Federal
      Government,&mdash;that Mr. Lincoln went up to attend the first session of
      the new Legislature at Vandalia. He was big with projects: his real public
      service was just now about to begin. In the previous Legislature he had
      been silent, observant, studious. He had improved the opportunity so well,
      that of all men in this new body, of equal age in the service, he was the
      smartest parliamentarian and the cunningest "log-roller." He was fully
      determined to identify himself conspicuously with the "liberal"
      legislation in contemplation, and dreamed of a fame very different from
      that which he actually obtained as an antislavery leader. It was about
      this time that he told his friend, Mr. Speed, that he aimed at the great
      distinction of being called "the De Witt Clinton of Illinois."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings with a view to this sort of legislation had been held in all, or
      nearly all, the counties in the State during the preceding summer and
      fall. Hard-money, strict-construction, no-monopoly, anti-progressive
      Democrats were in a sad minority. In truth, there was little division of
      parties about these matters which were deemed so essential to the
      prosperity of a new State. There was Mr. Lincoln, and there was Mr.
      Douglas, in perfect unison as to the grand object to be accomplished, but
      mortally jealous as to which should take the lead in accomplishing it. A
      few days before the Legislature assembled, "a mass convention" of the
      people of Sangamon County "instructed" their members "to vote for a <i>general
      system of internal improvements</i>." The House of Representatives
      organized in the morning; and in the evening its hall was surrendered to a
      convention of delegates from all parts of the State, which "devised and
      recommended to the Legislature a system of internal improvements, the
      chief feature of which was, that it should be commensurate with the wants
      of the people." This result was arrived at after two days of debate, with
      "Col. Thomas Mather, of the State Bank, as president."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln served on the Committee on Finance, and was a most laborious
      member, instant in season and out of season, for the great measures of the
      Whig party. It was to his individual exertion that the Whigs were indebted
      in no small degree for the complete success of their favorite schemes at
      this session. A railroad from Galena to the mouth of the Ohio was provided
      for; another from Alton to Shawneetown; another from Alton to Mount
      Carmel; another from Alton to the eastern boundary of the State towards
      Terre Haute; another from Quincy by way of Springfield to the Wabash;
      another from Bloomington to Pekin; another from Peoria to Warsaw,&mdash;in
      all about thirteen hundred miles. But in this comprehensive "system,"
      "commensurate with the wants of the people," the rivers were not to be
      overlooked; and accordingly the Kaskaskia, the Illinois, the Great Wabash,
      the Little Wabash, and the Rock rivers were to be duly improved. To set
      these little matters in motion, a loan of eight millions of dollars was
      authorized; and, to complete the canal from Chicago to Peru, another loan
      of four millions of dollars was voted at the same session,&mdash;two
      hundred thousand dollars being given as a gratuity to those counties which
      seemed to have no special interest in any of the foregoing projects. Work
      on all these roads was to commence, not only at the same time, but at both
      ends of each road, and at all the river-crossings. There were as yet no
      surveys of any route, no estimates, no reports of engineers, or even
      unprofessional viewers. "Progress" was not to wait on trifles; capitalists
      were supposed to be lying in wait to catch these precious bonds; the money
      would be raised in a twinkling, and being applied with all the skill of "a
      hundred De Witt Clintons,"&mdash;a class of gentlemen at that time
      extremely numerous and obtrusive,&mdash;the loan would build the
      railroads, the railroads would build cities, cities would create farms,
      foreign capital would rush to so inviting a field, the lands would be
      taken up with marvellous celerity, and the "land-tax" going into a sinking
      fund, <i>that</i>, with some tolls and certain sly speculations to be made
      by the State, would pay principal and interest of the debt without ever a
      cent of taxation upon the people. In short, everybody was to be enriched,
      while the munificence of the State in selling its credit and spending the
      proceeds would make its empty coffers overflow with ready money. It was a
      dark stroke of statesmanship, a mysterious device in finance, which,
      whether from being misunderstood, or from being mismanaged, bore from the
      beginning fruits the very reverse of those it had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Board of Canal Commissioners was already in existence; but now were
      established, as necessary parts of the new "system," a Board of Fund
      Commissioners and a Board of Commissioners of Public Works.

      The capital stock of the Shawneetown Bank was increased to one million
      seven hundred thousand dollars, and that of the State Bank to three
      million one hundred thousand dollars. The State took the new stock, and
      proposed to pay for it "with the surplus revenues of the United States,
      and the residue by a sale of State bonds." The banks were likewise made
      fiscal agencies, to place the loans, and generally to manage the railroad
      and canal funds. The career of these banks is an extremely interesting
      chapter in the history of Illinois,&mdash;little less so than the rise and
      collapse of the great internal-improvement system. But, as it has already
      a place in a chronicle of wider scope and greater merit than this, it is
      enough to say that in due time they went the way of their kind,&mdash;the
      State lost by them, and they lost by the State, in morals as well as in
      money.

      The means used in the Legislature to pass the "system" deserve some notice
      for the instruction of posterity. "First, a large portion of the people
      were interested in the success of the canal, which was threatened, if
      other sections of the State were denied the improvements demanded by them;
      and thus the friends of the canal were forced to log-roll for that work by
      supporting others which were to be ruinous to the country. Roads and
      improvements were proposed everywhere, to enlist every section of the
      State. Three or four efforts were made to pass a smaller system; and, when
      defeated, the bill would be amended by the addition of other roads, until
      a majority was obtained for it. Those counties which could not be thus
      accommodated were to share in the fund of two hundred thousand dollars.
      Three roads were appointed to terminate at Alton, before the Alton
      interest would agree to the system. The seat of government was to be
      removed to Springfield. Sangamon County, in which Springfield is situated,
      was then represented by two Senators and seven Representatives, called the
      'Long Nine,' all Whigs but one. Amongst them were some dexterous jugglers
      and managers in politics, whose whole object was to obtain the seat of
      government for Springfield. This delegation, from the beginning of the
      session, threw itself as a unit in support of, or in opposition to, every
      local measure of interest, but never without a bargain for votes in return
      on the seat-of-government question. Most of the other counties were small,
      having but one Representative and many of them with but one for a whole
      representative district; and this gave Sangamon County a decided
      preponderance in the log-rolling system of those days. It is worthy of
      examination whether any just and equal legislation can ever be sustained
      where some of the counties are great and powerful, and others feeble. But
      by such means 'The Long-Nine' rolled along like a snowball, gathering
      accessions of strength at every turn, until they swelled up a considerable
      party for Springfield, which party they managed to take almost as a unit
      in favor of the internal-improvement system, in return for which the
      active supporters of that system were to vote for Springfield to be the
      seat of government. Thus it was made to cost the State about six millions
      of dollars to remove the seat of government from Vandalia to Springfield,
      half of which sum would have purchased all the real estate in that town at
      three prices; and thus by log-rolling on the canal measure; by multiplying
      railroads; by terminating three railroads at Alton, that Alton might
      become a great city in opposition to St. Louis; by distributing money to
      some of the counties to be wasted by the county commissioners; and by
      giving the seat of government to Springfield,&mdash;was the whole State
      bought up, and bribed to approve the most senseless and disastrous policy
      which ever crippled the energies of a growing country." 1

      Enumerating the gentlemen who voted for this combination of evils,&mdash;among
      them Stephen A. Douglas, John A. McClernand, James Shields, and Abraham
      Lincoln,&mdash;and reciting the high places of honor and trust to which
      most of them have since attained, Gov. Ford pronounces "all of them spared
      monuments of popular wrath, evincing how safe it is to a politician, but

      "It was a maxim with many politicians just to keep along even with the
      humor of the people, right or wrong;" and this maxim Mr. Lincoln held
      then, as ever since, in very high estimation. But the "humor" of his
      constituents was not only intensely favorable to the new scheme of
      internal improvements: it was most decidedly their "humor" to have the
      capital at Springfield, and to make a great man of the legislator who
      should take it there. Mr. Lincoln was doubtless thoroughly convinced that
      the popular view of all these matters was the right one; but, even if he
      had been unhappily afflicted with individual scruples of his own, he would
      have deemed it but simple duty to obey the almost unanimous voice of his
      constituency. He thought he never could serve them better than by giving
      them just what they wanted; and that to collect the will of his people,
      and register it by his own vote, was the first and leading obligation of a
      representative. It happened that on this occasion the popular feeling fell
      in very pleasantly with his young dream of rivalling the fame of Clinton;
      and here, also, was a fine opportunity of repeating, in a higher strain
      and on a loftier stage, the ingenious arguments, which, in the very outset
      of his career, had proved so hard for "Posey and Ewing," when he overthrew
      those worthies in the great debate respecting the improvement of the
      Sangamon River.

      "The Internal-Improvement Bill," says Mr. Wilson (one of the "Long Nine"),
      "and a bill to permanently locate the seat of government of the State,
      were the great measures of the session of 1836-7. Vandalia was then the
      seat of government, and had been for a number of years. A new state house
      had just been built. Alton, Decatur, Peoria, Jacksonville, Illiapolis, and
      Springfield were the points seeking the location, if removed from
      Vandalia. The delegation from Sangamon were a unit, acting in concert in
      favor of the permanent location at Springfield. The bill was introduced at
      an early day in the session, to locate, by a joint vote of both Houses of
      the Legislature. The friends of the other points united to defeat the
      bill, as each point thought the postponement of the location to some
      future period would give strength to their location. The contest on this
      bill was long and severe. Its enemies laid it on the table twice,&mdash;once
      on the table to the fourth day of July, and once indefinitely postponed
      it. To take a bill from the table is always attended with difficulty; but
      when laid on the table to a day beyond the session, or when indefinitely
      postponed, it requires a vote of reconsideration, which always is an
      intense struggle. In these dark hours, when our bill to all appearances
      was beyond resuscitation, and all our opponents were jubilant over our
      defeat, and when friends could see no hope, Mr. Lincoln never for one
      moment despaired; but, collecting his colleagues to his room for
      consultation, his practical common sense, his thorough knowledge of human
      nature, then made him an overmatch for his compeers, and for any man that
      I have ever known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We surmounted all obstacles, passed the bill, and, by a joint vote of
      both Houses, located the seat of government of the State of Illinois at
      Springfield, just before the adjournment of the Legislature, which took
      place on the fourth day of March, 1837. The delegation acting during the
      whole session upon all questions as a unit, gave them strength and
      influence, that enabled them to carry through their measures and give
      efficient aid to their friends. The delegation was not only remarkable for
      their numbers, but for their length, most of them measuring six feet and
      over. It was said at the time that that delegation measured fifty-four
      feet high. Hence they were known as 'The Long Nine.' So that during that
      session, and for a number of years afterwards, all the bad laws passed at
      that session of the Legislature were chargeable to the management and
      influence of 'The Long Nine.'

      "He (Mr. Lincoln) was on the stump and in the halls of the Legislature a
      ready debater, manifesting extraordinary ability in his peculiar manner of
      presenting his subject. He did not follow the beaten track of other
      speakers and thinkers, but appeared to comprehend the whole situation of
      the subject, and take hold of its principles. He had a remarkable faculty
      for concentration, enabling him to present his subject in such a manner,
      as nothing but conclusions were presented."

      It was at this session of the Legislature, March 3, 1837, that Mr. Lincoln
      began that antislavery record upon which his fame through all time must
      chiefly rest. It was a very mild beginning; but even that required
      uncommon courage and candor in the day and generation in which it was
      done.

      The whole country was excited concerning the doctrines and the practices
      of the Abolitionists. These agitators were as yet but few in numbers: but
      in New England they comprised some of the best citizens, and the leaders
      were persons of high character, of culture and social influence; while, in
      the Middle States, they were, for the most part, confined to the Society
      of Friends, or Quakers. All were earnest, active, and uncompromising in
      the propagation of their opinions; and, believing slavery to be the "sum
      of all villanies," with the utmost pertinacity they claimed the
      unrestricted right to disseminate their convictions in any manner they saw
      fit, regardless of all consequences. They paid not the slightest heed to
      the wishes or the opinions of their opponents. They denounced all
      compromises with an unsparing tongue, and would allow no law of man to
      stand, in their eyes, above the law of God.

      George Thompson, identified with emancipation in the British West Indies,
      had come and gone. For more than a year he addressed public meetings in
      New England, the Central States, and Ohio, and contributed not a little to
      the growing excitement by his fierce denunciations of the slave-holding
      class, in language with which his long agitation in England had made him
      familiar. He was denounced, insulted, and mobbed; and even in Boston he
      was once posted as an "infamous foreign scoundrel," and an offer was made
      of a hundred dollars to "snake him out" of a public meeting. In fact,
      Boston was not at all behind other cities and towns in its condemnation of
      the Abolitionists. A great meeting in Faneuil Hall, called by eighteen
      hundred leading citizens,&mdash;Whigs and Democrats,&mdash;condemned their
      proceedings in language as strong and significant as Richard Fletcher,
      Peleg Sprague, and Harrison Gray Otis could write it. But Garrison still
      continued to publish "The Liberator," filling it with all the
      uncompromising aggressiveness of his sect, and distributing it throughout
      the Southern States. It excited great alarm in the slaveholding
      communities where its secret circulation, in the minds of the
      slaveholders, tended to incite the slaves to insurrections,
      assassinations, and running away; but in the place where it was published
      it was looked upon with general contempt and disgust. When the Mayor of
      Baltimore wrote to the Mayor of Boston to have it suppressed, the latter
      (the eloquent Otis) replied, "that his officers had ferreted out the paper
      and its editor, whose office was an obscure hole; his only visible
      auxiliary a negro boy; his supporters a few insignificant persons of all
      colors."

      At the close of the year 1835, President Jackson had called the attention
      of Congress to the doings of these people in language corresponding to the
      natural wrath with which he viewed the character of their proceedings. "I
      must also," said he, "invite your attention to the painful excitements in
      the South by attempts to circulate through the mails inflammatory appeals
      addressed to the passions of slaves, in prints and various sorts of
      publications calculated to stimulate them to insurrection, and to produce
      all the horrors of civil war. It is fortunate for the country that the
      good sense, the generous feeling, and deep-rooted attachment of the people
      of the non-slaveholding States to the Union and their fellow-citizens of
      the same blood in the South have given so strong and impressive a tone to
      the sentiments entertained against the proceedings of the misguided
      persons who have engaged in these unconstitutional and wicked attempts,
      and especially against the emissaries from foreign parts, who have dared
      to interfere in this matter, as to authorize the hope that these attempts
      will no longer be persisted in.... I would therefore call the special
      attention of Congress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the
      propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties,
      the circulation in the Southern States, through the mail, of incendiary
      publications, intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection."

      Mr. Clay said the sole purpose of the Abolitionists was to array one
      portion of the Union against the other. "With that in view, in all their
      leading prints and publications, the alleged horrors of slavery are
      depicted in the most glowing and exaggerated colors, to excite the
      imaginations and stimulate the rage of the people of the Free States
      against the people of the slaveholding States.... Why are the Slave States
      wantonly and cruelly assailed? Why does the abolition press teem with
      publications tending to excite hatred and animosity on the part of the
      Free States against the Slave States?... Why is Congress petitioned? Is
      their purpose to appeal to our understanding, and actuate our humanity?
      And do they expect to accomplish that purpose by holding us up to the
      scorn and contempt and detestation of the people of the Free States and
      the whole civilized world?... Union on the one side will beget union on
      the other.... One section will stand in menacing, hostile array against
      another; the collision of opinion will be quickly followed by the clash of
      arms."

    <p>
      Mr. Everett, then (1836) Governor of Massachusetts, informed the
      Legislature, for the admonition of these unsparing agitators against the
      peace of the South, that "every thing that tends to disturb the relations
      created by this compact [the Constitution] is at war with its spirit; and
      whatever, by direct and necessary operation, is calculated to excite an
      insurrection among the slaves, has been held by highly respectable legal
      authority an offence against the peace of this Commonwealth, which may be
      prosecuted as a misdemeanor at common law." It was proposed in the
      Legislature to pass an act defining the offence with more certainty, and
      attaching to it a severer penalty. The Abolitionists asked to be heard
      before the committee; and Rev. S. J. May, Ellis Gray Loring, Prof. Charles
      Follen, Samuel E. Sewell, and others of equal ability and character, spoke
      in their behalf. They objected to the passage of such an act in the
      strongest terms, and derided the value of a Union which could not protect
      its citizens in one of their most cherished rights. During the hearing,
      several bitter altercations took place between them and the chairman.

    <p>
      In New York, Gov. Marcy called upon the Legislature "to do what may be
      done consistently with the great principles of civil liberty, to put an
      end to the evils which the Abolitionists are bringing upon us and the
      whole country." The "character" and the "interests" of the State were
      equally at stake, and both would be sacrificed unless these furious and
      cruel fanatics were effectually suppressed.

      In May, 1836, the Federal House of Representatives resolved, by
      overwhelming votes, that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery
      in the States, or in the District of Columbia, and that henceforth all
      abolition petitions should be laid on the table without being printed or
      referred. And, one day later than the date of Mr. Lincoln's protest, Mr.
      Van Buren declared in his inaugural, that no bill abolishing slavery in
      the District of Columbia, or meddling with it in the States where it
      existed, should ever receive his signature. "There was no other form,"
      says Benton, "at that time, in which slavery agitation could manifest
      itself, or place it could find a point to operate; the ordinance of 1787
      and the compromise of 1820 having closed up the Territories against it.
      Danger to slave property in the States, either by direct action, or
      indirectly through the District of Columbia, were the only points of
      expressed apprehension."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abolition agitations fared little better in the twenty-fifth Congress than
      in the twenty-fourth. At the extra session in September of 1837, Mr. Slade
      of Vermont introduced two petitions for the abolition of slavery in the
      District of Columbia; but, after a furious debate and a stormy scene, they
      were disposed of by the adoption of the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That all petitions, memorials, and papers, touching the
      abolition of slavery, or the buying, selling, or transferring of slaves,
      in any State, District, or Territory, of the United States, be laid on the
      table, without being debated, printed, read, or referred; and that no
      further action whatever shall be had thereon."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Illinois, at the time we speak of (March, 1837), an Abolitionist was
      rarely seen, and scarcely ever heard of. In many parts of the State such a
      person would have been treated as a criminal. It is true, there were a few
      Covenanters, with whom hatred of slavery in any form and wherever found
      was an essential part of their religion. Up to 1824 they had steadily
      refused to vote, or in any other way to acknowledge the State government,
      regarding it as "an heathen and unbaptized institution," because the
      Constitution failed to recognize "Jesus Christ as the head of the
      government, and the Holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith and
      practice." It was only when it was proposed to introduce slavery into
      Illinois by an alteration of that "heathen" Constitution, that the
      Covenanters consented to take part in public affairs. The movement which
      drew them out proved to be a long and unusually bitter campaign, lasting
      full eighteen months, and ending in the fall of 1824, with a popular
      majority of several thousand against calling a convention for the purpose
      of making Illinois a Slave State. Many of the antislavery leaders in <i>this</i>
      contest&mdash;conspicuous among whom was Gov. Coles&mdash;were gentlemen
      from Slave States, who had emancipated their slaves before removal, and
      were opposed to slavery, not upon religious or moral grounds, but because
      they believed it would be a material injury to the new country.
      Practically no other view of the question was discussed; and a person who
      should have undertaken to discuss it from the "man and brother"
      stand-point of more modern times would have been set down as a lunatic. A
      clear majority of the people were against the introduction of slavery into
      their own State; but that majority were fully agreed with their brethren
      of the minority, that those who went about to interfere with slavery in
      the most distant manner in the places where it already existed were
      deserving of the severest punishment, as the common enemies of society. It
      was in those days a mortal offence to call a man an Abolitionist, for
      Abolitionist was synonymous with thief. Between a band of men who stole
      horses and a band of men who stole negroes, the popular mind made small
      distinctions in the degrees of guilt. They were regarded as robbers,
      disturbers of the peace, the instigators of arson, murder, poisoning,
      rape; and, in addition to all this, traitors to the government under which
      they lived, and enemies to the Union which gave us as a people liberty and
      strength. In testimony of these sentiments, Illinois enacted a "black
      code" of most preposterous and cruel severity,&mdash;a code that would
      have been a disgrace to a Slave State, and was simply an infamy in a free
      one. It borrowed the provisions of the most revolting laws known among
      men, for exiling, selling, beating, bedevilling, and torturing negroes,
      whether bond or free. Under this law Gov. Coles, the leader of the
      antislavery party, who had emancipated his slaves, and settled them around
      him in his new home, but had neglected to file a bond with the condition
      that his freedmen should behave well and never become a charge upon the
      public, was fined two hundred dollars in each case; and, so late as 1852,
      the writer of these pages very narrowly escaped the same penalty for the
      same offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1835-36 Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy had been publishing a moderately
      antislavery paper at St. Louis. But the people of that city did not look
      with favor upon his enterprise; and, after meeting with considerable
      opposition, in the summer of 1836 he moved his types and press across the
      river to Alton, Ill. Here he found an opposition more violent than that
      from which he had fled. His press was thrown into the river the night
      after its arrival; and he was informed that no abolition paper would be
      allowed in the town. The better class of citizens, however, deprecated the
      outrage, and pledged themselves to reimburse Mr. Lovejoy, in case he would
      agree not to make his paper an abolition journal. Mr. Lovejoy assured them
      it was not his purpose to establish such a paper in Alton, but one of a
      religious character: at the same time he would not give up his right as an
      American citizen to publish whatever he pleased on any subject, holding
      himself answerable to the laws of his country in so doing. With this
      general understanding, he was permitted to go forward. He continued about
      a year, discussing in his paper the slavery question occasionally; not,
      however, in a violent manner, but with a tone of moderation. This policy,
      however, was not satisfactory: it was regarded as a violation of his
      pledge; and the contents of his office were again destroyed. Mr. Lovejoy
      issued an appeal for aid to re-establish his paper, which met with a
      prompt and generous response. He proposed to bring up another press, and
      announced that armed men would protect it: meantime, a committee presented
      him with some resolutions adopted at a large meeting of the citizens of
      Alton, reminding him that he had previously given a pledge that in his
      paper he would refrain from advocating abolitionism) and also censuring
      him for not having kept his promise, and desiring to know if he intended
      to continue the publication of such doctrines in the future. His response
      consisted of a denial of the right of any portion of the people of Acton
      to prescribe what questions he should or should not discuss in his paper.
      Great excitement followed: another press was brought up on the 21st of
      September, which shortly after followed the fate of its predecessors.
      Another arrived Nov. 7, 1837, and was conveyed to a stone warehouse by the
      riverside, where Mr. Lovejoy and a few friends (some of them not
      Abolitionists) resolved to defend it to the last. That night they were
      attacked. First there was a brief parley, then a volley of stones, then an
      attempt to carry the building by assault. At this juncture a shot was
      fired out of a second-story window, which killed a young man in the crowd.
      It was said to have been fired by Lovejoy; and, as the corpse was borne
      away, the wrath of the populace knew no bounds. It was proposed to get
      powder from the magazine, and blow the warehouse up. Others thought the
      torch would be a better agent; and, finally, a man ran up a ladder to fire
      the roof. Lovejoy came out of the door, and, firing one shot, retreated
      within, where he rallied the garrison for a sortie. In the mean time many
      shots were fired both by the assailants and the assailed. The house was
      once actually set on fire by one person from the mob, and saved by
      another. But the courage of Mr. Lovejoy's friends was gradually sinking,
      and they responded but faintly to his strong appeals for action. As a last
      resource, he rushed to the door with a single companion, gun in hand, and
      was shot dead on the threshold. The other man was wounded in the leg, the
      warehouse was in flames, the mob grew more ferocious over the blood that
      had been shed, and riddled the doors and windows with volleys from all
      sorts of fire-arms. The Abolitionists had fought a good fight; but seeing
      now nothing but death before them, in that dismal, bloody, and burning
      house, they escaped down the river-bank, by twos and threes, as best they
      could, and their press was tumbled after them, into the river. And thus
      ended the first attempt to establish an abolition paper in Illinois. The
      result was certainly any thing but encouraging, and indicated pretty
      clearly what must have been the general state of public feeling throughout
      the State in regard to slavery agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, no State was more alive to the necessity of repressing the
      Abolitionists than Illinois; and accordingly it was proposed in the
      Legislature to take some action similar to that which had been already
      taken, or was actually pending, in the legislatures of sister
      Commonwealths, from Massachusetts through the list. A number of
      resolutions were reported, and passed with no serious opposition. The
      record does not disclose the precise form in which they passed; but that
      is of little consequence now. That they were extreme enough may be
      gathered from the considerate language of the protest, and from the fact
      that <i>such a protest</i> was considered necessary at all. The protest
      was undoubtedly the product of Mr. Lincoln's pen, for his adroit
      directness is seen in every word of it. He could get but one man&mdash;his
      colleague, Dan Stone&mdash;to sign with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 3,1837.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following protest was presented to the House, which was read, and
      ordered to be spread on the journals, to wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both
      branches of the General Assembly at its present session, the undersigned
      hereby protest against the passage of the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice
      and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends
      rather to increase than abate its evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power, under
      the Constitution, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the
      different States.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power, under
      the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but that
      the power ought not to be exercised, unless at the request of the people
      of the District.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said
      resolutions is their reason for entering this protest.
    </p>
    <p>

      A. Lincoln, Representatives from the County of Sanqamon.

    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln says nothing here about slavery in the Territories. The
      Missouri Compromise being in full force, and regarded as sacred by all
      parties, it was one of its chief effects that both sections were deprived
      of any pretext for the agitation of that question, from which every
      statesman, Federalist or Republican, Whig or Democratic, apprehended
      certain disaster to the Union. Neither would Mr. Lincoln suffer himself to
      be classed with the few despised Quakers, Covenanters, and Puritans, who
      were so frequently disturbing the peace of the country by
      abolition-memorials to Congress and other public bodies. Slavery, says the
      protest, is wrong in principle, besides being bad in economy; but "the
      promulgation of abolition doctrines" is still worse. In the States which
      choose to have it, it enjoys a constitutional immunity beyond the reach of
      any "higher law;" and Congress must not touch it, otherwise than to shield
      and protect it. Even in the District of Columbia, Mr. Lincoln and Dan
      Stone would leave it entirely to the will of the people. In fact, the
      whole paper, plain and simple as it is, seems to have been drawn with no
      object but to avoid the imputation of extreme views on either side. And
      from that day to the day of his inauguration, Mr. Lincoln never saw the
      time when he would have altered a word of it. He never sided with the
      Lovejoys. In his eyes their work tended "rather to increase than to abate"
      the evils of slavery, and was therefore unjust, as well as futile. Years
      afterwards he was the steady though quiet opponent of Owen Lovejoy, and
      declared that Lovejoy's nomination for Congress over Leonard Swett "almost
      turned him blind." When, in 1860, the Democrats called Mr. Lincoln an
      Abolitionist, and cited the protest of 1837 to support the charge, friends
      pointed to the exact language of the document as his complete and
      overwhelming refutation.

      On the 10th of May, the New York banks suspended specie payments, and two
      days afterwards the Bank of the United States and the Philadelphia banks
      did likewise. From these the stoppage and the general ruin, among business
      men and speculators alike, spread throughout the country. Nevertheless,
      the Fund Commissioners of Illinois succeeded in placing a loan during the
      summer, and before the end of the year work had begun on many railroads.
      "Money was as plenty as dirt. Industry, in place of being stimulated,
      actually languished. We exported nothing, and every thing was paid for by
      the borrowed money expended among us." And this money was bank-paper, such
      as a pensioner upon the Government of the United States scorned to take in
      payment of his gratuity, after the deposit banks had suspended or broken,
      with thirty-two millions of Government money in their possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banks which had received such generous legislation from the
      Legislature that devised the internal-improvement system were not disposed
      to see that batch of remarkable enterprises languish for want of their
      support. One of them took at par and sold nine hundred thousand dollars of
      bonds; while the other took one million seven hundred and sixty-five
      thousand dollars, which it used as capital, and expanded its business
      accordingly. But the banks were themselves in greater danger than the
      internal-improvement system. If the State Bank refused specie payments for
      sixty days, its charter was forfeited under the Act of Assembly. But they
      were the main-stay of all the current speculations, public and private;
      and having besides large sums of public money in their hands, the governor
      was induced to call a special session of the Legislature in July, 1837, to
      save them from impending dissolution. This was done by an act authorizing
      or condoning the suspension of specie payments. The governor had not
      directly recommended this, but he had most earnestly recommended the
      repeal or modification of the internal-improvement system; and <i>that</i>
      the Legislature positively refused. This wise body might be eaten by its
      own dogs, but it was determined not to eat <i>them</i>; and in this
      direction there was no prospect of relief for two years more. According to
      Gov. Ford, the cool, reflecting men of the State anxiously hoped that
      their rulers might be able to borrow no more money, but in this they were
      immediately and bitterly disappointed. The United States Bank took some of
      their bonds. Some were sold at par in this country, and others at nine per
      cent discount in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1838, a governor (Carlin) was elected who was thought by many to be
      secretly hostile to the "system;" and a new Legislature was chosen, from
      which it was thought something might be hoped. Mr. Lincoln was again
      elected, with a reputation so much enhanced by his activity and address in
      the last Legislature, that this time he was the candidate of his party for
      speaker. The nomination, however, was a barren honor, and known to be such
      when given. Col. Ewing was chosen by a plurality of one,&mdash;two Whigs
      and two Democrats scattering their votes. Mr. Lincoln kept his old place
      on the Finance Committee. At the first session the governor held his peace
      regarding the "system;" and, far from repealing it, the Legislature added
      a new feature to it, and voted another $800,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Fund Commissioners were in deep water and muddy water: they had
      reached the end of their string. The credit of the State was gone, and
      already were heard murmurs of repudiation. Bond County had in the
      beginning pronounced the system a swindle upon the people; and Bond County
      began to have admirers. Some of the bonds had been lent to New York State
      banks to start upon; and the banks had presently failed. Some had been
      sold on credit. Some were scattered about in various places on special
      deposit. Others had been sent to London for sale, where the firm that was
      selling them broke with the proceeds of a part of them in their hands. No
      expedients sufficed any longer. There was no more money to be got, and
      nothing left to do, but to "wind up the system," and begin the work of
      common sense by providing for the interest on the sums already expended. A
      special session of the Legislature in 1838-9 did the "winding up," and
      thenceforth, for some years, there was no other question so important in
      Illinois State politics as how to pay the interest on the vast debt
      outstanding for this account. Many gentlemen discovered that De Witt
      Clintons were rare, and in certain contingencies very precious. Among
      these must have been Mr. Lincoln. But being again, elected to the
      Legislature in 1840, again the acknowledged leader and candidate of his
      party for speaker, he ventured in December of that year to offer an
      expedient for paying the interest on the debt; but it was only an
      expedient, and a very poor one, to avoid the obvious but unpopular resort
      of direct taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln moved to strike out the bill and amendment, and insert the
      following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Act providing for the payment of interest on the State debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 1.&mdash;Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois
      represented in the General Assembly, that the governor be authorized and
      required to issue, from time to time, such an amount of State bonds, to be
      called the 'Illinois Interest Bonds,' as may be absolutely necessary for
      the payment of the interest upon the lawful debt of the State, contracted
      before the passage of this Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 2.&mdash;Said bonds shall bear interest at the rate of&mdash;&mdash;per
      cent per annum, payable half-yearly at&mdash;&mdash;, and be reimbursable
      in years from their respective issuings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 3.&mdash;That the State's portion of the tax hereafter arising
      from all lands which were not taxable in the year one thousand eight
      hundred and forty is hereby set apart as an exclusive fund for the payment
      of interest on the said 'Illinois Interest Bonds;' and the faith of the
      State is hereby pledged that said fund shall be applied to that object,
      and no other, except at any time there should be a surplus; in which case
      such surplus shall became a part of the general funds of the treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Section 4.&mdash;That hereafter the sum of thirty cents for each hundred
      dollars' worth of all taxable property shall be paid into the State
      treasury; and no more than forty cents for each hundred dollars' worth of
      such taxable property shall be levied and collected for county purposes."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a loose document. The governor was to determine the "amount" of
      bonds "necessary," and the sums for which they should be issued. Interest
      was to be paid only upon the "lawful" debt; and the governor was left to
      determine what part of it <i>was</i> lawful, and what unlawful. The last
      section lays a specific tax; but the proceeds are in no way connected with
      the "interest bonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln said he submitted this proposition with great diffidence. He
      had felt his share of the responsibility devolving upon us in the present
      crisis; and, after revolving in his mind every scheme which seemed to
      afford the least prospect of relief, he submitted this as the result of
      his own deliberations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The details of the bill might be imperfect; but he relied upon the
      correctness of its general features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the plan proposed in the original bill of hypothecating our bonds, he
      was satisfied we could not get along more than two or three months before
      some other step would be necessary: another session would have to be
      called, and new provisions made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be objected that these bonds would not be salable, and the money
      could not be raised in time. He was no financier; but he believed these
      bonds thus secured would be equal to the best in market. A perfect
      security was provided for the interest; and it was this characteristic
      that inspired confidence, and made bonds salable. If there was any
      distrust, it could not be because our means of fulfilling promises were
      distrusted. He believed it would have the effect to raise our other bonds
      in market.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was another objection to this plan, which applied to the original
      bill; and that was as to the impropriety of borrowing money to pay
      interest on borrowed money,&mdash;that we are hereby paying compound
      interest. To this he would reply, that, if it were a fact that our
      population and wealth were increasing in a ratio greater than the
      increased interest hereby incurred, then this was not a good objection. If
      our increasing means would justify us in deferring to a future time the
      resort to taxation, then we had better pay compound interest than resort
      to taxation now. He was satisfied, that, by a direct tax now, money enough
      could not be collected to pay the accruing interest. The bill proposed to
      provide in this way for interest not otherwise provided for. It was not
      intended to apply to those bonds for the interest on which a security had
      already been provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hoped the House would seriously consider the proposition. He had no
      pride in its success as a measure of his own, but submitted it to the
      wisdom of the House, with the hope, that, if there was any thing
      objectionable in it, it would be pointed out and amended."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln's measure did not pass. There was a large party in favor, not
      only of passing the interest on the State debt, which fell due in the
      coming January and July, but of repudiating the whole debt outright.
      Others thought the State ought to pay, not the full face of its bonds, but
      only the amount received for them; while others still contended that,
      whereas, many of the bonds had been irregularly, illegally, and even
      fraudulently disposed of, there ought to be a particular discrimination
      made against <i>these</i>, and these only. "At last Mr. Cavarly, a member
      from Green, introduced a bill of two sections, authorizing the Fund
      Commissioners to hypothecate internal-improvement bonds to the amount of
      three hundred thousand dollars, and which contained the remarkable
      provision, that the proceeds were to be applied by that officer to the
      payment of all interest <i>legally</i> due on the public debt; thus
      shifting from the General Assembly, and devolving on the Fund
      Commissioner, the duty of deciding on the legality of the debt. Thus, by
      this happy expedient, conflicting opinions were reconciled without direct
      action on the matter in controversy, and thus the two Houses were enabled
      to agree upon a measure to provide temporarily for the interest on the
      public debt. The Legislature further provided, at this session, for the
      issue of interest bonds, to be sold in the market at what they would
      bring; and an additional tax of ten cents on the hundred dollars' worth of
      property was imposed and pledged, to pay the interest on these bonds. By
      these contrivances, the interest for January and July, 1841, was paid. The
      Fund Commissioner hypothecated internal-improvement bonds for the money
      first due; and his successor in office, finding no sale for Illinois
      stocks, so much had the credit of the State fallen, was compelled to
      hypothecate eight hundred and four thousand dollars of interest bonds for
      the July interest. On this hypothecation he was to have received three
      hundred and twenty-one thousand six hundred dollars, but was never paid
      more than two hundred and sixty-one thousand five hundred dollars. These
      bonds have never been redeemed from the holders, though eighty of them
      were afterwards repurchased, and three hundred and fifteen thousand
      dollars of them were received from the Shawneetown Bank for State stock in
      that institution."1

    <p>
      This session (the session of 1840-1) had been called two weeks earlier
      than usual, to provide for the January interest on the debt. But the banks
      had important business of their own in view, and proceeded to improve the
      occasion. In 1837, and every year since then, the banks had succeeded in
      getting acts of the Legislature which condoned their suspension of specie
      payments. But, by the terms of the last act, their charters were forfeited
      unless they resumed before the adjournment of the next session. The
      Democrats, however, maintained that the present special session was <i>a
      session</i> in the sense of the law, and that, before its adjournment, the
      banks must hand out "the hard," or die. On the other hand, the Whigs held
      this session, and the regular session which began on the first Monday in
      December, to be one and the same, and proposed to give the banks another
      winter's lease upon life and rags. But the banks were a power in the land,
      and knew how to make themselves felt. They were the depositories of the
      State revenues. The auditor's warrants were drawn upon them, and the
      members of the Legislature paid in their money. The warrants were at a
      discount of fifty per cent; and, if the banks refused to cash them, the
      members would be compelled to go home more impecunious than they came. The
      banks, moreover, knew how to make "opportune loans to Democrats;" and,
      with all these aids, they organized a brilliant and eventually a
      successful campaign. In the eyes of the Whigs they were "the institutions
      of the country," and the Democrats were guilty of incivism in attacking
      them. But the Democrats retorted with a string of overwhelming slang about
      rag barons, rags, printed lies, bank vassals, ragocracy, and the
      "British-bought, bank, blue-light, Federal, Whig party." It was a fierce
      and bitter contest; and, witnessing it, one might have supposed that the
      very existence of the State, with the right to life, liberty, and the
      pursuit of happiness, depended upon the result. The Democrats were bent
      upon carrying an adjournment <i>sine die</i>; which, according to their
      theory, killed the banks. To defeat this, the Whigs resorted to every
      expedient of parliamentary tactics, and at length hit upon one entirely
      unknown to any of the standard manuals: they tried to absent themselves in
      sufficient numbers to leave no quorum behind. "If the Whigs absented
      themselves," says Mr. Gillespie, a Whig member, "there would not be a
      quorum left, even with the two who should be deputed to call the ayes and
      noes. The Whigs immediately held a meeting, and resolved that they would
      all stay out, except Lincoln and me, who were to call the ayes and noes.
      We appeared in the afternoon: motion to adjourn <i>sine die</i> was made,
      and we called the ayes and noes. The Democrats discovered the game, and
      the sergeant-at-arms was sent out to gather up the absentees. There was
      great excitement in the House, which was then held in a church at
      Springfield. We soon discovered that several Whigs had been caught and
      brought in, and that the plan had been spoiled; and we&mdash;Lincoln and I&mdash;determined
      to leave the hall, and, going to the door, found it locked, and then
      raised a window and jumped out, but not until the Democrats had succeeded
      in adjourning. Mr. Grid-ley of McLean accompanied us in our exit.... I
      think Mr. Lincoln always regretted that he entered into that arrangement,
      as he deprecated every thing that savored of the revolutionary."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the debate on the Apportionment Bill, Mr. Lincoln had
      occasion to address the House in defence of "The Long Nine," who were
      especially obnoxious to the Democrats. The speech concluded with the
      following characteristic passage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman had accused old women of being partial to the number nine;
      but this, he presumed, was without foundation. A few years since, it would
      be recollected by the House, that the delegation from this county were
      dubbed by way of eminence 'The Long Nine,' and, by way of further
      distinction, he had been called 'The Longest of the Nine.' Now," said Mr.
      Lincoln, "I desire to say to my friend from Monroe (Mr. Bissell), that if
      any woman, old or young, ever thought there was any peculiar charm in this
      distinguished specimen of number nine, I have as yet been so unfortunate
      as not to have discovered it." (Loud applause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Legislature was full of excitements. Besides the questions about
      the public debt and the bank-charters, the Democrats proposed to legislate
      the Circuit judges out of office, and reconstruct the Supreme Court to
      suit themselves. They did this because the Supreme judges had already
      decided one question of some political interest against them, and were now
      about to decide another in the same way. The latter was a question of
      great importance; and, in order to avoid the consequences of such a
      decision, the Democrats were eager for the extremest measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Constitution provided that all free white male <i>inhabitants</i>
      should vote upon six months' residence. This, the Democrats held, included
      aliens; while the Whigs held the reverse. On this grave judicial question,
      parties were divided precisely upon the line of their respective
      interests. The aliens numbered about ten thousand, and nine-tenths of them
      voted steadily with the Democracy. Whilst a great outcry concerning it was
      being made from both sides, and fierce disputes raged in the newspapers
      and on the stump, two Whigs at Galena got up an amicable case, to try it
      in a quiet way before a Whig judge, who held the Circuit Courts in their
      neighborhood. The judge decided for his friends, like a man that he was.
      The Democrats found it out, and raised a popular tumult about it that
      would have put Demetrius the silversmith to shame. They carried the case
      to the Supreme Court, where it was argued before the Whig majority, in
      December, 1889, by able and distinguished counsellors,&mdash;Judge Douglas
      being one of them; but the only result was a continuance to the next June.
      In the mean time Judge Smith, the only Democrat on the bench, was seeking
      favor with his party friends by betraying to Douglas the secrets of the
      consultation-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his aid, the Democrats found a defect in the record, which sent the
      case over to December, 1840, and adroitly secured the alien vote for the
      great elections of that memorable year. The Legislature elected then was
      overwhelmingly Democratic; and, having good reason to believe that the
      aliens had small favor to expect from this court, they determined
      forthwith to make a new one that would be more reasonable. There were now
      nine Circuit judges in the State, and four Supreme judges, under the Act
      of 1835. The offices of the Circuit judges the Democrats concluded to
      abolish, and to create instead nine Supreme judges, who should perform
      circuit duties. This they called "reforming the judiciary;" and "thirsting
      for vengeance," as Gov. Ford says, they went about the work with all the
      zeal, but with very little of the disinterested devotion, which reformers
      are generally supposed to have. Douglas, counsel for one of the litigants,
      made a furious speech "in the lobby," demanding the destruction of the
      court that was to try his cause; and for sundry grave sins which he
      imputed to the judges he gave Smith&mdash;his friend Smith&mdash;as
      authority. It was useless to oppose it: this "reform" was a foregone
      conclusion. It was called the "Douglas Bill;" and Mr. Douglas was
      appointed to one of the new offices created by it. But Mr. Lincoln, E. D.
      Baker, and other Whig members, entered upon the journal the following
      protest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the reasons thus presented, and for others no less apparent, the
      undersigned cannot assent to the passage of the bill, or permit it to
      become a law without this evidence of their disapprobation; and they now
      protest against the re-organization of the judiciary: Because,
    </p>
    <p>
      "1st. It violates the great principles of free government by subjecting
      the judiciary to the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2d. It is a fatal blow at the independence of the judges and the
      constitutional term of their offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "3d. It is a measure not asked for, or wished for, by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "4th. It will greatly increase the expense of our courts, or else greatly
      diminish their utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "5th. It will give our courts a political and partisan character, thereby
      impairing public confidence in their decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "6th. It will impair our standing with other States and the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "7th. It is a party measure for party purposes, from which no practical
      good to the people can possibly arise, but which may be the source of
      immeasurable evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether
      unavailing with the majority of this body. The blow has already fallen;
      and we are compelled to stand by, the mournful spectators of the ruin it
      will cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was elected in 1840, to serve, of course, until the next
      election in August, 1842; but for reasons of a private nature, to be
      explained hereafter, he did not appear during the session of 1841-2.
    </p>
    <p>
      In concluding this chapter, taking leave of New Salem, Vandalia, and the
      Legislature, we cannot forbear another quotation from Mr. Wilson,
      Lincoln's colleague from Sangamon, to whom we are already so largely in
      debt:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In 1838 many of the Long Nines were candidates for re-election to the
      Legislature. A question of the division of the county was one of the local
      issues. Mr. Lincoln and myself, among others, residing in the portion of
      the county sought to be organized into a new county, and opposing the
      division, it became necessary that I should make a special canvass through
      the north-west part of the county, then known as Sand Ridge. I made the
      canvass; Mr. Lincoln accompanied me; and, being personally well acquainted
      with every one, we called at nearly every house. At that time it was the
      universal custom to keep some whiskey in the house, for private use and to
      treat friends. The subject was always mentioned as a matter of etiquette,
      but with the remark to Mr. Lincoln, 'You never drink, but maybe your
      friend would like to take a little.' I never saw Mr. Lincoln drink. He
      often told me he never drank; had no desire for drink, nor the
      companionship of drinking men. Candidates never treated anybody in those
      times unless they wanted to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln remained in New Salem until the spring of 1837, when he went
      to Springfield, and went into the law-office of John T. Stuart as a
      partner in the practice of law, and boarded with William Butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "During his stay in New Salem he had no property other than what was
      necessary to do his business, until after he stopped in Springfield. He
      was not avaricious to accumulate property, neither was he a spendthrift.
      He was almost always during those times hard up. He never owned land.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first trip he made around the circuit after he commenced the practice
      of law, I had a horse, saddle, and bridle, and he had none. I let him have
      mine. I think he must have been careless, as the saddle skinned the
      horse's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While he lived in New Salem he visited me often. He would stay a day or
      two at a time: we generally spent the time at the stores in Athens. He was
      very fond of company: telling or hearing stories told was a source of
      great amusement to him. He was not in the habit of reading much,&mdash;never
      read novels. Whittling pine boards and shingles, talking and laughing,
      constituted the entertainment of the days and evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a conversation with him about that time, he told me, that, although he
      appeared to enjoy life rapturously, still he was the victim of terrible
      melancholy. He sought company, and indulged in fun and hilarity without
      restraint, or stint as to time; but when by himself, he told me that he
      was so overcome by mental depression that he never dared carry a knife in
      his pocket; and as long as I was intimately acquainted with him, previous
      to his commencement of the practice of the law, he never carried a
      pocket-knife. Still he was not misanthropic: he was kind and
      tender-hearted in his treatment to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the summer of 1837 the citizens of Athens and vicinity gave the
      delegation then called the 'Long Nine' a public dinner, at which Mr.
      Lincoln and all the others were present. He was called out by the toast,
      'Abraham Lincoln, one of Nature's noblemen.' I have often thought, that,
      if any man was entitled to that compliment, it was he."

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      UNDER the Act of Assembly, due in great part to Mr. Lincoln's exertions,
      the removal of the archives and other public property of the State from
      Vandalia to Springfield began on the fourth day of July, 1839, and was
      speedily completed. At the time of the passage of the Act, in the winter
      of 1836-7, Mr. Lincoln determined to follow the capital, and establish his
      own residence at Springfield. The resolution was natural and necessary;
      for he had been studying law in all his intervals of leisure, and wanted a
      wider field than the justice's court at New Salem to begin the practice.
      Henceforth Mr. Lincoln might serve in the Legislature, attend to his
      private business, and live snugly at home. In addition to the State
      courts, the Circuit and District Courts of the United States sat here. The
      eminent John McLean of Ohio was the justice of the Supreme Court who sat
      in this circuit, with Judge Pope of the District Court, from 1839 to 1849,
      and after that with Judge Drummond. The first terms of these courts, and
      the first session of the Legislature at Springfield, were held in
      December, 1839. The Senate sat in one church, and the House in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln got his license as an attorney early in 1837, "and commenced
      practice regularly as a lawyer in the town of Springfield in March" of
      that year. His first case was that of Hawthorne vs. Wooldridge, dismissed
      at the cost of the plaintiff, for whom Mr. Lincoln's name was entered.
      There were then on the list of attorneys at the Springfield bar many names
      of subsequent renown. Judge Stephen T. Logan was on the bench of the
      Circuit Court under the Act of 1835. Stephen A. Douglas had made his
      appearance as the public prosecutor at the March term of 1836; and at the
      same term E. D. Baker had been admitted to practice. Among the rest were
      John T. Stuart, Cyrus Walker, S. H. Treat, Jesse B. Thomas, George
      Forquer, Dan Stone, Ninian W. Edwards, John J. Hardin, Schuyler Strong, A.
      T. Bledsoe, and Josiah Lamborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Mr. Lincoln enjoyed considerable local fame as a politician,
      but none, of course, as a lawyer. He therefore needed a partner, and got
      one in the person of John T. Stuart, an able and distinguished Whig, who
      had relieved his poverty years before by the timely loan of books with
      which to study law, and who had from the first promoted his political
      fortunes with zeal as disinterested as it was effective. The connection
      promised well for Mr. Lincoln, and no doubt did well during the short
      period of its existence. The courtroom was in Hoffman's Row; and the
      office of Stuart &amp; Lincoln was in the second story above the
      court-room. It was a "little room," and generally a "dirty one." It
      contained "a small dirty bed,"&mdash;on which Lincoln lounged and slept,&mdash;a
      buffalo-robe, a chair, and a bench. Here the junior partner, when
      disengaged from the cares of politics and the Legislature, was to be found
      pretty much all the time, "reading, abstracted and gloomy." Springfield
      was a small village, containing between one and two thousand inhabitants.
      There were no pavements: the street-crossings were made of "chunks,"
      stones, and sticks. Lincoln boarded with Hon. William Butler, a gentleman
      who possessed in an eminent degree that mysterious power which guides the
      deliberations of party conventions and legislative bodies to a foregone
      conclusion. Lincoln was very poor, worth nothing, and in debt,&mdash;circumstances
      which are not often alleged in behalf of the modern legislator; but "Bill
      Butler" was his friend, and took him in with little reference to
      board-bills and the settlement of accounts. According to Dr. Jayne, he
      "fed and clothed him for years;" and this signal service, rendered at a
      very critical time, Mr. Lincoln forgot wholly when he was in Congress, and
      Butler wanted to be Register of the Land Office, as well as when he was
      President of the United States, and opportunities of repayment were
      multitudinous. It is doubtless all true; but the inference of personal
      ingratitude on the part of Mr. Lincoln will not bear examination. It will
      be shown at another place that Mr. Lincoln regarded all public offices
      within his gift as a sacred trust, to be administered solely for the
      people, and as in no sense a fund upon which he could draw for the payment
      of private accounts. He <i>never</i> preferred his friends to his enemies,
      but rather the reverse, as if fearful that he might by bare possibility be
      influenced by some unworthy motive. He was singularly cautious to avoid
      the imputation of fidelity to his friends at the expense of his opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Coke's and Blackstone's time the law was supposed to be "a jealous
      mistress;" but in Lincoln's time, and at Springfield, she was any thing
      but exacting. Politicians courted her only to make her favor the
      stepping-stone to success in other employments. Various members of that
      bar have left great reputations to posterity, but none of them were earned
      solely by the legitimate practice of the law. Douglas is remembered as a
      statesman, Baker as a political orator, Hardin as a soldier, and some now
      living, like Logan and Stuart, although eminent in the law, will be no
      less known to the history of the times as politicians than as lawyers.
      Among those who went to the law for a living, and to the people for fame
      and power, was Mr. Lincoln. He was still a member of the Legislature when
      he settled at Springfield, and would probably have continued to run for a
      seat in that body as often as his time expired, but for the unfortunate
      results of the "internal-improvement system," the hopeless condition of
      the State finances, and a certain gloominess of mind, which arose from
      private misfortunes that befell him about the time of his retirement. We
      do not say positively that these were the reasons why Mr. Lincoln made no
      effort to be re-elected to the Legislature of 1840; but a careful study of
      all the circumstances will lead any reasonable man to believe that they
      were. He was intensely ambitious, longed ardently for place and
      distinction, and never gave up a prospect which seemed to him good when he
      was in a condition to pursue it with honor to himself and fairness to
      others. Moreover State politics were then rapidly ceasing to be the
      high-road to fame and fortune. Although the State of Illinois was
      insolvent, unable to pay the interest on her public debt, and many were
      talking about repudiating the principal, the great campaign of 1840 went
      off upon national issues, and little or nothing was said about questions
      of State policy. Mr. Lincoln felt and obeyed this tendency of the public
      mind, and from 1837 onward his speeches&mdash;those that were printed and
      those that were not&mdash;were devoted chiefly, if not exclusively, to
      Federal affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, 1837, he delivered a lecture before the Springfield Lyceum on
      the subject of the "<i>Perpetuation of our Free Institutions</i>." As a
      mere declamation, it is unsurpassed in the annals of the West. Although
      delivered in mid-winter, it is instinct with the peculiar eloquence of the
      most fervid Fourth of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the great journal of things," began the orator, "happening under the
      sun, we, the American People, find our account running under date of the
      nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful
      possession of the fairest portion of the earth, as regards extent of
      territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves
      under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more
      essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which
      the history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of
      existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental
      blessings. We toiled not in the acquisition or establishment of them: they
      are a legacy bequeathed us by a <i>once</i> hardy, brave, and patriotic,
      but <i>now</i> lamented and departed race of ancestors. Theirs was the
      task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and, through
      themselves, us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and
      valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights: 'tis ours only to
      transmit these&mdash;the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the
      latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation&mdash;to
      the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task,
      gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity,&mdash;all
      imperatively require us faithfully to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the
      approach of danger? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to
      step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe,
      Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own
      excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could
      not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue
      Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years!
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer,
      if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from
      abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and
      finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by
      suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am not over-wary; but, if I am not, there is even now something
      of ill-omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which
      pervades the country, the growing disposition to substitute the wild and
      furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse
      than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This disposition
      is awfully fearful in any community, and that it now exists in ours,
      though grating to our feelings to admit it, it would be a violation of
      truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages
      committed by mobs form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded
      the country from New England to Louisiana; they are neither peculiar to
      the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning sun of the latter. They
      are not the creature of climate; neither are they confined to the
      slaveholding or non-slaveholding States. Alike they spring up among the
      pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves and the order-loving citizens
      of the land of steady habits. Whatever, then, their cause may be, it is
      common to the whole country."
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator then adverts to the doings of recent mobs in various parts of
      the country, and insists, that, if the spirit that produced them continues
      to increase, the laws and the government itself must fall before it: bad
      citizens will be encouraged, and good ones, having no protection against
      the lawless, will be glad to receive an individual master who will be able
      to give them the peace and order they desire. That will be the time when
      the usurper will put down his heel on the neck of the people, and batter
      down the "fair fabric" of free institutions. "Many great and good men," he
      says, "sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever
      be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in
      Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair; <i>but such belong not
      to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle.</i>1 What! Think you
      these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Cæsar, or a Napoleon? Never!
      Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto
      unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the
      monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is
      glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps
      of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for
      distinction; and, if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of
      emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen.... Another reason which once <i>was</i>,
      but which, to the same extent, <i>is now no more</i>, has done much in
      maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the powerful influence which
      the interesting scenes of the Revolution had upon the <i>passions</i> of
      the people as distinguished from their judgment." This influence, the
      lecturer maintains, was kept alive by the presence of the surviving
      soldiers of the Revolution, who were in some sort "living histories," and
      concludes with this striking peroration:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But those histories are gone. They <i>can</i> be read no more forever.
      They <i>were</i> a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman could
      never do, the silent artillery of time <i>has done</i>,&mdash;the
      levelling of its walls. They are gone. They <i>were</i> a forest of giant
      oaks; but the all-resistless hurricane has swept over them, and left only
      here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its
      foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes,
      and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more rude storms, then to
      sink and be no more. They <i>were</i> the pillars of the temple of
      liberty; and now that they have crumbled away, that temple must fall,
      unless we, the descendants, supply their places with other pillars hewn
      from the same solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but can
      do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason&mdash;cold,
      calculating, unimpassioned reason&mdash;must furnish all the materials for
      our future support and defence. Let those materials be moulded into <i>general
      intelligence, sound morality</i>, and, in particular, <i>a reverence for
      the Constitution and the laws</i>; and that we improved to the last, that
      we revered his name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted
      no hostile foot to pass or desecrate his resting-place, shall be that
      which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington. Upon these let
      the proud fabric of freedom rest as the rock of its basis, and as truly as
      has been said of the only greater institution, 'The gates of hell shall
      not prevail against it."'

      These extracts from a lecture carefully composed by Mr. Lincoln at the
      mature age of twenty-eight, and after considerable experience in the
      public service, are worthy of attentive perusal. To those familiar with
      his sober and pure style at a later age, these sophomoric passages will
      seem incredible. But they were thought "able and eloquent" by the "Young
      Men's Lyceum" of Springfield: he was "solicited to furnish a copy for
      publication," and they were duly printed in "The Sangamon Journal." In the
      mere matter of rhetoric, they compare favorably with some of his other
      productions of nearly the same date. This was what he would have called
      his "growing time;" and it is intensely interesting to witness the
      processes of such mental growth as his. In time, gradually, but still
      rapidly, his style changes completely: the constrained and unnatural
      attempts at striking and lofty metaphor disappear, and the qualities which
      produced the Gettysburg address&mdash;that model of unadorned eloquence&mdash;begin
      to be felt. He finds the people understand him better when he comes down
      from his stilts, and talks to them from their own level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political discussions at Springfield were apt to run into heated and
      sometimes unseemly personal controversies. When Douglas and Stuart were
      candidates for Congress in 1838, they fought like tigers in Herndon's
      grocery, over a floor that was drenched with slops, and gave up the
      struggle only when both were exhausted. Then, as a further entertainment
      to the populace, Mr. Stuart ordered out a "barrel of whiskey and wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the election-day in 1840, it was reported to Mr. Lincoln that one
      Radford, a contractor on the railroad, had brought up his men, and taken
      full possession of one of the polling-places. Lincoln started off to the
      precinct on a slow trot. Radford knew him well, and a little stern advice
      reversed proceedings without any fighting. Among other remarks, Lincoln
      said, "Radford, you'll spoil and blow if you live much longer." He wanted
      to hit Radford, but could get no chance to do so, and contented himself
      with confiding his intentions to Speed. "I intended just to knock him
      down, and leave him kicking."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same year, Col. Baker was making a speech to a promiscuous audience in
      the court-room,&mdash;"a rented room in Hoffman's Row." It will be
      remembered that Lincoln's office was just above, and he was listening to
      Baker through a large hole or trap-door in the ceiling. Baker warmed with
      his theme, and, growing violent and personally offensive, declared at
      length, "that wherever there was a land-office, there was a Democratic
      newspaper to defend its corruptions." "This," says John B. Webber, "was a
      personal attack on my brother, George Webber. I was in the Court House,
      and in my anger cried, 'Pull him down!'" A scene of great confusion
      ensued, threatening to end in a general riot, in which Baker was likely to
      suffer. But just at the critical moment Lincoln's legs were seen coming
      through the hole; and directly his tall figure was standing between Baker
      and the audience, gesticulating for silence. "Gentlemen," said he, "let us
      not disgrace the age and country in which we live. This is a land where
      freedom of speech is guaranteed. Mr Baker has a right to speak, and ought
      to be permitted to do so. I am here to protect him, and no man shall take
      him from this stand if I can prevent it." Webber only recollects that
      "some one made some soothing, kind remarks," and that he was properly
      "held until the excitement ceased," and the affair "soon ended in quiet
      and peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1838, or 1840, Jesse B. Thomas made an intemperate attack upon the
      "Long Nine," and especially upon Mr. Lincoln, as the longest and worst of
      them. Lincoln was not present at the meeting; but being sent for, and
      informed of what had passed, he ascended the platform, and made a reply
      which nobody seems to remember, but which everybody describes as a
      "terrible skinning" of his victim. Ellis says, that, at the close of a
      furious personal denunciation, he wound up by "mimicking" Thomas, until
      Thomas actually cried with vexation and anger. Edwards, Speed, Ellis,
      Davis, and many others, refer to this scene, and, being asked whether Mr.
      Lincoln could not be vindictive upon occasion, generally respond,
      "Remember the Thomas skinning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The most intimate friend Mr. Lincoln ever had, at this or any other time,
      was probably Joshua F. Speed. In 1836 he settled himself in Springfield,
      and did a thriving business as a merchant. Ellis was one of his clerks,
      and so also was William H. Herndon, Mr. Lincoln's future partner. This
      store was for years Lincoln's familiar haunt. There he came to while away
      the tedious evenings with Speed and the congenial company that naturally
      assembled around these choice spirits. He even slept in the store room as
      often as he slept at home, and here made to Speed the most confidential
      communications he ever made to mortal man. If he had on earth "a bosom
      crony," it was Speed, and that deep and abiding attachment subsisted
      unimpaired to the day of Mr. Lincoln's death. In truth, there were good
      reasons why he should think of Speed with affection and gratitude, for
      through life no man rendered him more important services.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night in December, 1839, Lincoln, Douglas, Baker, and some other
      gentlemen of note, were seated at Speed's hospitable fire in the store.
      They got to talking politics, got warm, hot, angry. Douglas sprang up and
      said, "Gentlemen, this is no place to talk politics: we will discuss the
      questions publicly with you," and much more in a high tone of banter and
      defiance. A few days afterwards the Whigs had a meeting, at which Mr.
      Lincoln reported a resolution challenging the Democrats to a joint debate.
      The challenge was accepted; and Douglas, Calhoun, Lamborn, and Jesse B.
      Thomas were deputed by the Democrats to meet Logan, Baker, Browning, and
      Lincoln on the part of the Whigs. The intellectual encounter between these
      noted champions is still described by those who witnessed it as "the great
      debate." It took place in the Second Presbyterian Church, in the hearing
      of as many people as could get into the building, and was adjourned from
      night to night. When Mr. Lincoln's turn came, the audience was very thin;
      but, for all that, his speech was by many persons considered the best one
      of the series. To this day, there are some who believe he had assistance
      in the preparation of it. Even Mr. Herndon accused Speed of having "had a
      hand in it," and got a flat denial for his answer. At all events, the
      speech was a popular success, and was written out, and published in "The
      Sangamon Journal," of March 6, 1840. The exordium was a sort of complaint
      that must have had a very depressing effect upon both the speaker and his
      hearers:&mdash;

    <p>
      "Fellow-Citizens,&mdash;It is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a
      continuance of the discussion, on this evening, which has been conducted
      in this hall on several preceding ones. It is so, because on each of these
      evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now, without any reason
      for its being so, except the greater interest the community feel in the
      speakers who addressed them then, than they do in him who is to do so now.
      I am, indeed, apprehensive that the few who have attended have done so
      more to spare me of mortification, than in the hope of being interested in
      any thing I may be able to say. This circumstance casts a damp upon my
      spirits which I am sure I shall be unable to overcome during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the Sub-Treasury scheme
      of the present administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping,
      transferring, and disbursing the revenues of the nation, as contrasted
      with a National Bank for the same purposes. Mr. Douglas has said that we
      (the Whigs) have not dared to meet them (the Locos) in argument on this
      question. I protest against this assertion. I say we have again and again,
      during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against the Sub-Treasury
      which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer. But lest
      some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question, I
      now propose, in my humble way, to urge these arguments again; at the same
      time begging the audience to mark well the positions I shall take, and the
      proofs I shall offer to sustain them, and that they will not again allow
      Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of them by a round and
      groundless assertion that we dare not meet them in argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the Sub-Treasury, then, as contrasted with a National Bank, for the
      before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "1st. It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the
      circulating medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2d. It will be a more expensive fiscal agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "3d. It will be a less secure depository for the public money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln's objections to the Sub-Treasury were those commonly urged by
      its enemies, and have been somewhat conclusively refuted by the operation
      of that admirable institution from the hour of its adoption to the
      present. "The extravagant expenditures" of Mr. Van Buren's administration,
      however, was a standard topic of the Whigs in those days, and, sliding
      gracefully off from the Sub-Treasury, Mr. Lincoln dilated extensively upon
      this more attractive subject. This part of his speech was entirely in
      reply to Mr. Douglas. But, when he came to answer Mr. Lamborn's remarks,
      he "got in a hard hit" that must have brought down the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and
      the Whigs is, that, although the former sometimes err in practice, they
      are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in
      principle; and, the better to impress this proposition, he uses a
      figurative expression in these words: 'The Democrats are vulnerable in the
      heel, but they are sound in the heart and head.' The first branch of the
      figure,&mdash;that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel,&mdash;I
      admit is not merely figuratively but literally true. Who that looks but
      for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and
      their hundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas,
      to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find
      refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly
      affected in their heels with a species of 'running itch.' It seems that
      this malady of their heels operates on the sound-headed and honest-hearted
      creatures very much like the cork-leg in the comic song did on its owner,
      which, when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it,
      the more it would run away. At the hazard of wearing this point
      threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems to be too strikingly in
      point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier who was always boasting of his
      bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without
      orders at the first charge of the engagement, being asked by his captain
      why he did so, replied, 'Captain, I have as brave a heart as Julius Cæsar
      ever had, but somehow or other, whenever danger approaches, my cowardly
      legs will run away with it.' So with Mr. Lamborn's party. They take the
      public money into their hands for the most laudable purpose that wise
      heads and honest hearts can dictate; but, before they can possibly get it
      out again, their rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as in the lecture before the Lyceum, Mr. Lincoln reserved his most
      impressive passage, his boldest imagery, and his most striking metaphor,
      for a grand and vehement peroration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lamborn refers to the late elections in the States, and, from their
      results, confidently predicts every State in the Union will vote for Mr.
      Van Buren at the next presidential election. Address that argument to
      cowards and knaves: with the free and the brave it will affect nothing. It
      may be true: if it must, let it. Many free countries have lost their
      liberty, and ours may lose hers; but, if she shall, be it my proudest
      plume, not that I was the last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I
      know that the great volcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the
      evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the lava of political
      corruption in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful
      velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to
      leave unscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are
      riding, like demons on the wave of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and
      fiendishly taunting all those who dare to resist its destroying course
      with the hopelessness of their efforts; and, knowing this, I cannot deny
      that all may be swept away. Broken by it, I, too, may be; bow to it, I
      never will. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to
      deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just. It shall not
      deter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those
      dimensions, not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I
      contemplate the cause of my country, deserted by all the world beside, and
      I standing up boldly, alone, hurling defiance at her victorious
      oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences, before Heaven and in
      face of the world, I swear eternal fealty to the just cause, as I deem it,
      of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love. And who that thinks with
      me will not fearlessly adopt that oath that I take? Let none falter who
      thinks he is right, and we may succeed. But if, after all, we shall fail,
      be it so: we still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our
      consciences, and to the departed shade of our country's freedom, that the
      cause approved of our judgment and adored of our hearts, in disaster, in
      chains, in torture, in death, we never faltered in defending."
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that the times were extremely peaceful, and that the speaker
      saw no bloodshed except what flowed from the noses of belligerents in the
      groceries about Springfield, the speech seems to have been unnecessarily
      defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1840 Mr. Lincoln was a candidate for presidential elector on the
      Harrison ticket, and stumped a large part of the State. He and Douglas
      followed Judge Treat's court all around the circuit, "and spoke in the
      afternoons." The Harrison club at Springfield became thoroughly familiar
      with his voice. But these one-sided affairs were not altogether suited to
      his temper: through his life he preferred a joint discussion, and the
      abler the man pitted against him, the better he liked it. He knew he shone
      in retort, and sought every opportunity to practise it. From 1838 to 1858,
      he seems to have followed up Douglas as a regular business during times of
      great political excitement, and only on one or two occasions did he find
      the "Little Giant" averse to a conflict. Here, in 1840, they came in
      collision, as they did in 1839, and as they continued to do through twenty
      or more years, until Lincoln became President of the United States, and
      Douglas's disappointments were buried with his body. Once during this
      Harrison campaign they had a fierce discussion before a meeting assembled
      in the market-house. In the course of his speech, Lincoln imputed to Van
      Buren the great sin of having voted in the New York State Convention for
      negro suffrage with a property qualification. Douglas denied the fact; and
      Lincoln attempted to prove his statement by reading a certain passage from
      Holland's "Life of Van Buren," containing a letter from Van Buren to one
      Mr. Fithian. Whereupon "Douglas got mad," snatched up the book, and,
      tossing it into the crowd, remarked sententiously, although not
      conclusively, "Damn such a book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was very sensitive," says Mr. Gillespie, "where he thought he had
      failed to come up to the expectations of his friends. I remember a case.
      He was pitted by the Whigs, in 1840, to debate with Mr. Douglas, the
      Democratic champion. Lincoln did not come up to the requirements of the
      occasion. He was conscious of his failure; and I never saw any man so much
      distressed. He begged to be permitted to try it again, and was reluctantly
      indulged; and in the next effort he transcended our highest expectations.
      I never heard, and never expect to hear, such a triumphant vindication as
      he then gave of Whig measures or policy. He never after, to my knowledge,
      fell below himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It must by this time be clear to the reader that Mr. Lincoln was never
      agitated by any passion more intense than his wonderful thirst for
      distinction. There is good evidence that it furnished the feverish dreams
      of his boyhood; and no man that knew him well can doubt that it governed
      all his conduct, from the hour when he astonished himself by his
      oratorical success against Posey and Ewing, in the back settlements of
      Macon County, to the day when the assassin marked him as the first hero of
      the restored Union, re-elected to his great office, surrounded by every
      circumstance that could minister to his pride, or exalt his sensibilities,&mdash;a
      ruler whose power was only less wide than his renown. He never rested in
      the race he had determined to run; he was ever ready to be honored; he
      struggled incessantly for place. There is no instance where an important
      office seemed to be within his reach, and he did not try to get it.
      Whatsoever he did in politics, at the bar, in private life, had more or
      less reference to this great object of his life. It is not meant to be
      said that he was capable of any shameful act, any personal dishonor, any
      surrender or concealment of political convictions. In these respects, he
      was far better than most men. It was not in his nature to run away from
      the fight, or to desert to the enemy; but he was quite willing to accept
      his full share of the fruits of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born in the humblest circumstances, uneducated, poor, acquainted with
      flatboats and groceries, but a stranger to the drawing-room, it was
      natural that he should seek in a matrimonial alliance those social
      advantages which he felt were necessary to his political advancement. This
      was, in fact, his own view of the matter; but it was strengthened and
      enforced by the counsels of those whom he regarded as friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Miss Mary Lincoln. Wife of the President 270]
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1839 Miss Mary, daughter of Hon. Robert S. Todd of Lexington, Ky., came
      to live with her sister, Mrs. Ninian W. Edwards, at Springfield. Like Miss
      Owens, Miss Todd had a stepmother, with whom she failed to "agree," and
      for that reason the Edwardses offered her a home with them. She was young,&mdash;just
      twenty-one,&mdash;her family was of the best, and her connections in
      Illinois among the most refined and distinguished people. Her mother
      having died when she was a little girl, she had been educated under the
      care of a French lady, "opposite Mr. Clay's." She was gifted with rare
      talents, had a keen sense of the ridiculous, a ready insight into the
      weaknesses of individual character, and a most fiery and ungovernable
      temper. Her tongue and her pen were equally sharp. High-bred, proud,
      brilliant, witty, and with a will that bent every one else to her purpose,
      she took Mr. Lincoln captive the very moment she considered it expedient
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was a rising politician, fresh from the people, and possessed
      of great power among them: Miss Todd was of aristocratic and distinguished
      family, able to lead through the awful portals of "good society"
      whomsoever they chose to countenance. It was thought that a union between
      them could not fail of numerous benefits to both parties. Mr. Edwards
      thought so; Mrs. Edwards thought so; and it was not long before Mary Todd
      herself thought so. She was very ambitious, and even before she left
      Kentucky announced her belief that she was "destined to be the wife of
      some future President." For a little while she was courted by Douglas as
      well as by Lincoln; but she is said to have refused the "Little Giant,"
      "on account of his bad morals." Being asked which of them she intended to
      have, she answered, "The one that has the best chance of being President."
      She decided in favor of Lincoln, and, in the opinion of some of her
      husband's friends, aided to no small extent in the fulfilment of the
      prophecy which the bestowal of her hand implied. A friend of Miss Todd was
      the wife of an elderly but wealthy gentleman; and being asked by one of
      the Edwards coterie why she had married "such an old, dried-up husband,
      such a withered-up old buck," she answered that "He had lots of horses and
      gold." But Mary Todd spoke up in great surprise, and said, "Is that true?
      I would rather marry a good man, a man of mind, with hope and bright
      prospects ahead for position, fame, and power, than to marry all the
      horses, gold, and bones in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Edwards, Miss Todd's sister, tells us that Mr. Lincoln "was charmed
      with Mary's wit and fascinated with her quick sagacity, her will, her
      nature and culture." "I have happened in the room," she says, "where they
      were sitting often and often, and Mary led the conversation. Lincoln would
      listen, and gaze on her as if drawn by some superior power,&mdash;irresistibly
      so: he listened, but never scarcely said a word.... Lincoln could not hold
      a lengthy conversation with a lady,&mdash;was not sufficiently educated
      and intelligent in the female line to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln and Mary were engaged, and their marriage was only a question
      of time. But Mr. Lincoln's love-affairs were destined never to run
      smoothly, and now one Miss Matilda Edwards made her "sweet appearance,"
      and brought havoc in her train. She was the sister of Ninian W. Edwards,
      and came to spend a year with her brother. She was very fair, and soon was
      the reigning belle. No sooner did Lincoln know her than he felt his heart
      change. The other affair, according to the Edwardses, according to Stuart,
      according to Herndon, according to Lincoln and everybody else, was a
      "policy match;" but <i>this</i> was love. For a while he evidently tried
      hard to go on as before, but his feelings were too strong to be concealed.
      Mr. Edwards endeavored to reconcile matters by getting his sister to marry
      Speed; but the rebellious beauty refused Speed incontinently (as she did
      Douglas too), and married Mr. Schuyler Strong. Poor Lincoln never
      whispered a word of his passion to her: his high sense of honor prevented
      that, and perhaps she would not have listened to him if it had been
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after long reflection, in great agony of spirit, Mr. Lincoln
      concluded that duty required him to make a candid statement of his
      feelings to the lady who was entitled to his hand. He wrote her a letter,
      and told her gently but plainly that he did not love her. He asked Speed
      to deliver it; but Speed advised him to burn it. "Speed," said Mr.
      Lincoln, "I always knew you were an obstinate man. If you won't deliver
      it, I'll get some one else to do it." But Speed now had the letter in his
      hand; and, emboldened by the warm friendship that existed between them,
      replied, "I shall not deliver it, nor give it to you to be delivered.
      Words are forgotten, misunderstood, passed by, not noticed in a private
      conversation; but once put your words in writing, and they stand as a
      living and eternal monument against you. If you think you have <i>will</i>
      and manhood enough to go and see her, and speak to her what you say in
      that letter, you may do that." Lincoln went to see her forthwith, and
      reported to Speed. He said, that, when he made his somewhat startling
      communication, she rose and said, "'The deceiver shall be deceived: woe is
      me!' alluding to a young man she had fooled." Mary told him she knew the
      reason of his change of heart, and released him from his engagement. Some
      parting endearments took place between them, and then, as the natural
      result of those endearments, a reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We quote again from Mrs. Edwards:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lincoln and Mary were engaged; every thing was ready and prepared for the
      marriage, even to the supper. Mr. Lincoln failed to meet his engagement.
      Cause, insanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his lunacy he declared he hated Mary and loved Miss Edwards. This is
      true, yet it was not his real feelings. A crazy man hates those he loves
      when at himself. Often, often, is this the case. The world had it that Mr.
      Lincoln backed out, and this placed Mary in a peculiar situation; and to
      set herself right, and free Mr. Lincoln's mind, she wrote a letter to Mr.
      Lincoln, stating that she would release him from his engagement.... The
      whole of the year was a crazy spell. Miss Edwards was at our house, say a
      year. I asked Miss Edwards if Mr. Lincoln ever mentioned the subject of
      his love to her. Miss Edwards said, 'On my word, he never mentioned such a
      subject to me: he never even stooped to pay me a compliment.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the language of Mr. Edwards, "Lincoln went as crazy as a loon," and was
      taken to Kentucky by Speed, who kept him "until he recovered." He "did not
      attend the Legislature in 1841-2 for this reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Herndon devoutly believes that Mr. Lincoln's insanity grew out of a
      most extraordinary complication of feelings,&mdash;aversion to the
      marriage proposed, a counter-attachment to Miss Edwards, and a new access
      of unspeakable tenderness for the memory of Ann Rutledge,&mdash;the old
      love struggling with a new one, and each sending to his heart a
      sacrificial pang as he thought of his solemn engagement to marry a third
      person. In this opinion Mr. Speed appears to concur, as shown by his
      letter below. At all events, Mr. Lincoln's derangement was nearly, if not
      quite, complete. "We had to remove razors from his room," says Speed,
      "take away all knives, and other dangerous things. It was terrible." And
      now Speed determined to do for him what Bowlin Greene had done on a
      similar occasion at New Salem. Having sold out his store on the 1st of
      January, 1841, he took Mr. Lincoln with him to his home in Kentucky, and
      kept him there during most of the summer and fall, or until he seemed
      sufficiently restored to be given his liberty again at Springfield, when
      he was brought back to his old quarters. During this period, "he was at
      times very melancholy," and, by his own admission, "almost contemplated
      self-destruction." It was about this time that he wrote some gloomy lines
      under the head of "Suicide," which were published in "The Sangamon
      Journal." Mr. Herndon remembered something about them; but, when he went
      to look for them in the office-file of the "Journal," he found them neatly
      cut out,&mdash;"supposed to have been done," says he, "by Lincoln."
      Speed's mother was much pained by the "deep depression" of her guest, and
      gave him a Bible, advising him to read it, to adopt its precepts, and pray
      for its promises. He acknowledged this attempted service, after he became
      President, by sending her a photograph of himself, with this inscription:
      "To my very good friend, Mrs. Lucy G. Speed, from whose pious hands I
      received an Oxford Bible twenty years ago." But Mrs. Speed's medicine, the
      best ever offered for a mind diseased, was of no avail in this case. Among
      other things, he told Speed, referring probably to his inclination to
      commit suicide, "that he had done nothing to make any human being remember
      that he had lived, and that to connect his name with the events
      transpiring in his day and generation, and so impress himself upon them as
      to link his name with something that would redound to the interest of his
      fellow-man, was what he desired to live for." Of this conversation he
      pointedly reminded Speed at the time, or just before the time, he issued
      the Emancipation Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What took place after his return to Springfield cannot be better told than
      in the words of the friends of both parties. "Mr. Edwards and myself,"
      says Mrs. Edwards, "after the first crash of things, told Mary and Lincoln
      that they had better not ever marry; that their natures, minds, education,
      raising, &amp;c., were so different, that they could not live happy as man
      and wife; had better never think of the subject again. All at once we
      heard that Mr. Lincoln and Mary had secret meetings at Mr. S. Francis's,
      editor of 'The Springfield Journal.' Mary said the reason this was so, the
      cause why it was, was that the world, woman and man, were uncertain and
      slippery, and that it was best to keep the secret courtship from all eyes
      and ears. Mrs. Lincoln told Mr. Lincoln, that, though she had released him
      in the letter spoken of, yet she would hold the question an open one,&mdash;that
      is, that she had not changed her mind, but felt as always.... The marriage
      of Mr. Lincoln and Mary was quick and sudden,&mdash;one or two hours'
      notice." How poor Mr. Lincoln felt about it, may be gathered from the
      reminiscences of his friend, J. H. Matheny, who says, "that Lincoln and
      himself, in 1842, were very friendly; that Lincoln came to him one evening
      and said, 'Jim, I shall have to marry that girl.'" He was married that
      evening, but Matheny says, "he looked as if he was going to the
      slaughter," and that Lincoln "had often told him, directly and
      individually, that he was driven into the marriage; that it was concocted
      and planned by the Edwards family; that Miss Todd&mdash;afterwards Mrs.
      Lincoln&mdash;was crazy for a week or so, not knowing what to do; and that
      he loved Miss Edwards, and went to see her, and not Mrs. Lincoln."
    </p>
    <p>
      The license to marry was issued on the 4th of November, 1842, and on the
      same day the marriage was celebrated by Charles Dresser, "M.G." With this
      date carefully borne in mind, the following letters are of surpassing
      interest. They are relics, not only of a great man, but of a great agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is from Mr. Speed to Mr. Herndon, and explains the circumstances
      under which the correspondence took place. Although it is in part a
      repetition of what the reader already knows, it is of such peculiar value,
      that we give it in full:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      W. H. Herndon, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;I enclose you copies of all the letters of any interest
      from Mr. Lincoln to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some explanation may be needed, that you may rightly understand their
      import.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter of 1840 and 1841 he was unhappy about his engagement to his
      wife,&mdash;not being entirely satisfied that his <i>heart</i> was going
      with his hand. How much he suffered then on that account, none know so
      well as myself: he disclosed his whole heart to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1841 I became engaged to my wife. He was here on a visit
      when I courted her; and, strange to say, something of the same feeling
      which I regarded as so foolish in him took possession of me, and kept me
      very unhappy from the time of my engagement until I was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will explain the deep interest he manifested in his letters on my
      account.

    <p>
      If you use the letters (and some of them are perfect gems) do it care
      fully, so as not to wound the feelings of Mrs. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing is plainly discernible: if I had not been married and happy,&mdash;far
      more happy than I ever expected to be,&mdash;he would not have married.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have erased a name which I do not wish published. If I have failed to do
      it anywhere, strike it out when you come to it. That is the word&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank you for your last lecture. It is all new to me, but so true to my
      appreciation of Lincoln's character, that, independent of my knowledge of
      you, I would almost swear to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln wrote a letter (a long one, which he read to me) to Dr. Drake, of
      Cincinnati, descriptive of his case. Its date would be in December, 1840,
      or early in January, 1841. I think that he must have informed Dr. D. of
      his early love for Miss Rutledge, as there was a part of the letter which
      he would not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be worth much to you, if you could procure the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles D. Drake, of St. Louis, may have his father's papers. The date
      which I give you will aid in the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember Dr. Drake's reply, which was, that he would not undertake to
      prescribe for him without a personal interview. I would advise you to make
      some effort to get the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend, &amp;c.,
    </p>
    <p>
      J. F. Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the papers from Mr. Lincoln's pen is a letter of advice and
      consolation to his friend, for whom he apprehends the terrible things
      through which, by the help of that friend, he has himself just passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Speed,&mdash;Feeling, as you know I do, the deepest solicitude for
      the success of the enterprise you are engaged in, I adopt this as the last
      method I can invent to aid you, in case (which God forbid) you shall need
      any aid. I do not place what I am going to say on paper, because I can say
      it better in that way than I could by word of mouth; but, were I to say it
      orally before we part, most likely you would forget it at the very time
      when it might do you some good. As I think it reasonable that you will
      feel very badly sometime between this and the final consummation of your
      purpose, it is intended that you shall read this just at such a time. Why
      I say it is reasonable that you will feel very badly yet, is because of
      three <i>special causes</i> added to <i>the general one</i> which I shall
      mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general cause is, that you are naturally of a nervous temperament, and
      this I say from what I have seen of you personally, and what you have told
      me concerning your mother at various times, and concerning your brother
      William at the time his wife died. The first special cause is your <i>exposure
      to bad weather</i> on your journey, which my experience clearly proves to
      be very severe on defective nerves. The second is the <i>absence of all
      business and conversation</i> of friends, which might divert your mind,
      give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which will sometimes
      wear the sweetest idea threadbare, and turn it to the bitterness of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third is <i>the rapid and near approach of that crisis on which all
      your thoughts and feelings concentrate.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If from all these causes you shall escape, and go through triumphantly,
      without another "twinge of the soul," I shall be most happily but most
      egregiously deceived. If, on the contrary, you shall, as I expect you will
      at some time, be agonized and distressed, let me, who have some reason to
      speak with judgment on such a subject, beseech you to ascribe it to the
      causes I have mentioned, and not to some false and ruinous suggestion of
      the Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," you will say, "do not your causes apply to every one engaged in a
      like undertaking?" By no means. <i>The particular causes</i>, to a greater
      or less extent, perhaps, do apply in all cases; but the <i>general one</i>,&mdash;nervous
      debility, which is the key and conductor of all the particular ones, and
      without which they would be utterly harmless, though it <i>does</i>
      pertain to you,&mdash;<i>does not</i> pertain to one in a thousand. It is
      out of this that the painful difference between you and the mass of the
      world springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are
      unhappy: it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should.
      What nonsense! How came you to court her? Was it because you thought she
      deserved it, and that you had given her reason to expect it? If it was for
      that, why did not the same reason make you court Ann Todd, and at least
      twenty others of whom you can think, and to whom it would apply with
      greater force than to <i>her?</i> Did you court her for her wealth? Why,
      you know she had none. But you say you reasoned yourself into it. What do
      you mean by that? Was it not that you found yourself unable to reason
      yourself out of it? Did you not think, and partly form the purpose, of
      courting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her? What had
      reason to do with it at that early stage? There was nothing at that time
      for reason to work upon. Whether she was moral, amiable, sensible, or even
      of good character, you did not, nor could then know, except, perhaps, you
      might infer the last from the company you found her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      All you then did or could know of her was her personal <i>appearance and
      deportment</i>; and these, if they impress at all, impress the heart, and
      not the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say candidly, were not those heavenly <i>black eyes</i> the whole basis of
      all your early <i>reasoning</i> on the subject? After you and I had once
      been at the residence, did you not go and take me all the way to Lexington
      and back, for no other purpose but to get to see her again, on our return
      on that evening to take a trip for that express object?
    </p>
    <p>
      What earthly consideration would you take to find her scouting and
      despising you, and giving herself up to another? But of this you have no
      apprehension; and therefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be so anxious about you, that I shall want you to write by every
      mail. Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Ill., Feb. 3, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Your letter of the 25th January came to hand to-day. You
      well know that I do not feel my own sorrows much more keenly than I do
      yours, when I know of them; and yet I assure you I was not much hurt by
      what you wrote me of your excessively bad feeling at the time you wrote.
      Not that I am less capable of sympathizing with you now than ever, not
      that I am less your friend than ever, but because I hope and believe that
      your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life must and
      will forever banish those horrid doubts which I know you sometimes felt as
      to the truth of your affection for her. If they can once and forever be
      removed (and I almost feel a presentiment that the Almighty has sent your
      present affliction expressly for that object), surely, nothing can come in
      their stead to fill their immeasurable measure of misery. The death-scenes
      of those we love are surely painful enough; but these we are prepared for
      and expect to see: they happen to all, and all know they must happen.
      Painful as they are, they are not an unlooked-for sorrow. Should she, as
      you fear, be destined to an early grave, it is indeed a great consolation
      to know that she is so well prepared to meet it.. Her religion, which you
      once disliked so much, I will venture you now prize most highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I hope your melancholy bodings as to her early death are not well
      founded. I even hope that ere this reaches you, she will have returned
      with improved and still-improving health, and that you will have met her,
      and forgotten the sorrows of the past in the enjoyment of the present. I
      would say more if I could, but it seems that I have said enough. It really
      appears to me that you yourself ought to rejoice, and not sorrow, at this
      indubitable evidence of your undying affection for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, Speed, if you did not love her, although you might not wish her
      death, you would most certainly be resigned to it. Perhaps this point is
      no longer a question with you, and my pertinacious dwelling upon it is a
      rude intrusion upon your feelings. If so, you must pardon me. You know the
      hell I have suffered on that point, and how tender I am upon it. You know
      I do not mean wrong. I have been quite clear of hypo since you left, even
      better than I was along in the fall. I have seen&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;but
      once. She seemed very cheerful, and so I said nothing to her about what we
      spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Uncle Billy Herndon is dead, and it is said this evening that Uncle
      Ben Ferguson will not live. This, I believe, is all the news, and enough
      at that, unless it were better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write me immediately on the receipt of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Ill., Feb. 13, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Yours of the 1st inst. came to hand three or four days
      ago. When this shall reach you, you will have been Fanny's husband several
      days. You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting; that I will never
      cease while I know how to do any thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will always hereafter be on ground that I have never occupied, and
      consequently, if advice were needed, I might advise wrong. I do fondly
      hope, however, that you will never again need any comfort from abroad.
      But, should I be mistaken in this, should excessive pleasure still be
      accompanied with a painful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as
      I have ever done, to remember, in the depth and even agony of despondency,
      that very shortly you are to feel well again. I am now fully convinced
      that you love her as ardently as you are capable of loving. Your ever
      being happy in her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if
      there were nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind. I
      incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally
      for a while; but once you get them firmly graded now, that trouble is over
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly right, I would
      avoid being <i>idle</i>. I would immediately engage in some business, or
      go to making preparations for it, which would be the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient composure
      not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond question, and in
      two or three months, to say the most, will be the happiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would desire you to give my particular respects to Fanny; but perhaps
      you will not wish her to know you have received this, lest she should
      desire to see it. Make her write me an answer to my last letter to her; at
      any rate, 1 would set great value upon a note or letter from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write me whenever you have leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours forever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;I have been quite a man since you left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Feb. 25, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Yours of the 16th inst., announcing that Miss Fanny and
      you are "no more twain, but one flesh," reached me this morning. I have no
      way of telling how much happiness I wish you both, though I believe you
      both can conceive it. I feel somewhat jealous of both of you now: you will
      be so exclusively concerned for one another, that I shall be forgotten
      entirely. My acquaintance with Miss Fanny (I call her this, lest you
      should think I am speaking of your mother) was too short for me to
      reasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I am sure I shall
      not forget her soon. Try if you cannot remind her of that debt she owes
      me,&mdash;and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to Illinois. I
      shall be very lonesome without you. How miserable things seem to be
      arranged in this world! If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and,
      if we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the
      loss. I did hope she and you would make your home here; but I own I have
      no right to insist. You owe obligations to her ten thousand times more
      sacred than you can owe to others, and in that light let them be respected
      and observed. It is natural that she should desire to remain with her
      relatives and friends. As to friends, however, <i>she</i> could not need
      them anywhere: she would have them in abundance here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his family, particularly
      Miss Elizabeth; also to your mother, brother, and sisters. Ask little
      Eliza Davis if she will ride to town with me if I come there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, finally, give Fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent
      me. Write me often, and believe me
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours forever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;Poor Easthouse is gone at last. He died a while before day
      this morning. They say he was very loath to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Feb. 25, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;I received yours of the 12th, written the day you went
      down to William's place, some days since, but delayed answering it till I
      should receive the promised one of the 16th, which came last night. I
      opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much, that,
      although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet, at the
      distance of ten hours, become calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I are peculiar) are
      all the worst sort of nonsense. I fancied, from the time I received your
      letter of Saturday, that the one of Wednesday was never to come, and yet
      it did come, and, what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from its tone
      and handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you think the term
      preferable, less miserable, when you wrote it, than when you wrote the
      last one before. You had so obviously improved at the very time I so much
      fancied you would have grown worse. You say that something indescribably
      horrible and alarming still haunts you. You will not say that three months
      from now, I will venture. When your nerves once get steady now, the whole
      trouble will be over forever. Nor should you become impatient at their
      being even very slow in becoming steady. Again you say, you much fear that
      that Elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be realized.
      Weil, if it shall not, I dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is
      now your wife. I now have no doubt, that it is the peculiar misfortune of
      both you and me to dream dreams of Elysium far exceeding all that any
      thing earthly can realize. Far short of your dreams as you may be, no
      woman could do more to realize them than that same black-eyed Fanny. If
      you could but contemplate her through my imagination, it would appear
      ridiculous to you that any one should for a moment think of being unhappy
      with her. My old father used to have a saying, that, "If you make a bad
      bargain, hug it all the tighter;" and it occurs to me, that, if the
      bargain you have just closed can possibly be called a bad one, it is
      certainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to which my fancy
      can by any effort picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show her, if she
      desires it. I do this because she would think strangely, perhaps, should
      you tell her that you received no letters from me, or, telling her you do,
      refuse to let her see them. I close this, entertaining the confident hope
      that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here pray may
      not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more steady hand
      and cheerful heart than the last preceding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ever, your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, March 27, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Yours of the 10th inst. was received three or four days
      since. You know I am sincere when I tell you the pleasure its contents
      gave me was and is inexpressible. As to your farm matter, I have no
      sympathy with you. I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and
      consequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested
      with it. I can only say that I am glad you are satisfied and pleased with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on that other subject, to me of the most intense interest whether in
      joy or sorrow, I never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you. It
      cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you say you are "<i>far
      happier than you ever expected to be</i>." That much I know is enough. I
      know you too well to suppose your expectations were not, at least,
      sometimes extravagant, and, if the reality exceeds them all, I say,
      Enough, dear Lord. I am not going beyond the truth when I tell you, that
      the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more pleasure
      than the total sum of all I have enjoyed since that fatal 1st of January,
      1841. Since then it seems to me I should have been entirely happy, but for
      the never-absent idea that there is <i>one</i> still unhappy whom I have
      contributed to make so. That still kills my soul. I cannot but reproach
      myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise. She
      accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last
      Monday, and on her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having enjoyed
      the trip exceedingly. God be praised for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched you ever since the
      commencement of your affair; and, although I am almost confident it is
      useless, I cannot forbear once more to say, that I think it is even yet
      possible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable. If they
      should, don't fail to remember that they cannot long remain so. One thing
      I can tell you which I know you will be glad to hear, and that is that I
      have seen&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and scrutinized her feelings as well as I
      could, and am fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for
      the last fifteen months past.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will see by the last "Sangamon Journal" that I have made a temperance
      speech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall read
      as an act of charity to me; for I cannot learn that anybody else has read
      it, or is likely to. Fortunately, it is not very long, and I shall deem it
      a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the
      other reads it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say that there has
      been no court since you left, and that the next commences to-morrow
      morning, during which I suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a
      discharge, for all trouble we have been at, to take his business out of
      our hands and give it to somebody else. It is impossible to collect money
      on that or any other claim here now, and, although you know I am not a
      very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr.
      Everett's endless importunity. It seems like he not only writes all the
      letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity
      to be constantly writing to us about his claim. I have always said that
      Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be
      obliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to
      collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would thank him to transfer
      his business to some other, without any compensation for what we have
      done, provided he will see the court cost paid, for which we are security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet violet you enclosed came safely to hand, but it was so dry, and
      mashed so flat, that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt to handle
      it. The juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the letter, which I
      mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be
      sent. My renewed good wishes to her in particular, and generally to all
      such of your relations who know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ever,

      Springfield, Ill., July 4, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Yours of the 16th June was received only a day or two
      since. It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th. You speak of the
      great time that has elapsed since I wrote you. Let me explain that. Your
      letter reached here a day or two after I had started on the circuit. I was
      gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks before
      Butler started to your country. I thought it scarcely worth while to write
      you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail. On his
      return, he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for your
      letter. As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely you know
      better than that. I know you do, and therefore will not labor to convince
      you. True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your silence, or
      the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it. I acknowledge
      the correctness of your advice too; but, before I resolve to do the one
      thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my
      resolves when they are made. In that ability you know I once prided
      myself, as the only or chief gem of my character: that gem I lost, how and
      where you know too well. I have not yet regained it; and, until I do, I
      cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance. I believe now, that,
      had you understood my case at the time as well as I understood yours
      afterwards, by the aid you would have given me I should have sailed
      through clear; but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to
      begin that or the like of that again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your present
      happiness. I am much pleased with that acknowledgment. But a thousand
      times more am I pleased, to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness
      worthy of an acknowledgment. The truth is, I am not sure that there was
      any went with me in the part I took in your difficulty: I was drawn to it
      as by fate. If I would, I could not have done less than I did. I always
      was superstitious: I believe God made me one of the instruments of
      bringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt he had
      fore-ordained. Whatever he designs, he will do for me yet. "Stand still,
      and see the salvation of the Lord" is my text just now. If, as you say,
      you have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this
      letter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it depend
      upon whether she has ever known any thing of my affairs; and, if she has
      not, do not let her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think I can come to Kentucky this season. I am so poor, and make
      so little headway in the world, that I drop back in a month of idleness as
      much as I gain in a year's sowing. I should like to visit you again. I
      should like to see that "sis" of yours that was absent when I was there,
      though I suppose she would run away again, if she were to hear I was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My respects and esteem to all your friends there, and, by your permission,
      my love to your Fanny. Ever yours, Lincoln.

      Dear Speed,&mdash;You have heard of my duel with Shields, and I have now
      to inform you that the duelling business still rages in this city. Day
      before yesterday Shields challenged Butler, who accepted, and proposed
      fighting next morning at sunrising in Bob Allen's meadow, one hundred
      yards' distance, with rifles. To this Whitesides, Shields's second, said
      "no," because of the law. Thus ended duel No. 2. Yesterday Whiteside chose
      to consider himself insulted by Dr. Merryman, so sent him a kind of <i>quasi</i>-challenge,
      inviting him to meet him at the Planter's House in St. Louis, on the next
      Friday, to settle their difficulty. Merryman made me his friend, and sent
      W. a note, inquiring to know if he meant his note as a challenge, and, if
      so, that he would, according to the law in such case made and provided,
      prescribe the terms of the meeting. W. returned for answer, that, if M.
      would meet him at the Planter's House as desired, he would challenge him.
      M. replied in a note, that he denied W.'s right to dictate time and place,
      but that he (M.) would waive the question of time, and meet him at
      Louisiana, Mo. Upon my presenting this note to W., and stating verbally
      its contents, he declined receiving it, saying he had business in St.
      Louis, and it was as near as Louisiana. Merryman then directed me to
      notify Whiteside that he should publish the correspondence between them,
      with such comments as he thought fit. This I did. Thus it stood at bedtime
      last night. This morning Whiteside, by his friend Shields, is praying for
      a new trial, on the ground that he was mistaken in Merryman's proposition
      to meet him at Louisiana, Mo., thinking it was the State of Louisiana.
      This Merryman hoots at, and is preparing his publication; while the town
      is in a ferment, and a street-fight somewhat anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I began this letter, not for what I have been writing, but to say
      something on that subject which you know to be of such infinite solicitude
      to me. The immense sufferings you endured from the first days of September
      till the middle of February you never tried to conceal from me, and I well
      understood. You have now been the husband of a lovely woman nearly eight
      months. That you are happier now than the day you married her, I well
      know; for without you could not be living. But I have your word for it,
      too, and the returning elasticity of spirits which is manifested in your
      letters. But I want to ask a close question, "Are you now in <i>feeling</i>,
      as well as <i>judgment</i>, glad you are married as you are?" From anybody
      but me this would be an impudent question, not to be tolerated; but I know
      you will pardon it in me. Please answer it quickly, as I am impatient to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sent my love to your Fanny so often, I fear she is getting tired of
      it. However, I venture to tender it again,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours forever,
    </p>

      Lincoln.

      In the last of these letters, Mr. Lincoln refers to his "duel with
      Shields." That was another of the disagreeable consequences which flowed
      from his fatal entanglement with Mary. Not content with managing a timid,
      although half-frantic and refractory, lover, her restless spirit led her
      into new fields of adventure. Her pen was too keen to be idle in the
      political controversies of the time. As a satirical writer, she had no
      rival of either sex at Springfield, and few, we venture to say, anywhere
      else. But that is a dangerous talent: the temptations to use it unfairly
      are numerous and strong; it inflicts so much pain, and almost necessarily
      so much injustice, upon those against whom it is directed, that its
      possessor rarely, if ever, escapes from a controversy without suffering
      from the desperation it provokes. Mary Todd was not disposed to let her
      genius rust for want of use; and, finding no other victim handy, she
      turned her attention to James Shields, "Auditor." She had a friend, one
      Miss Jayne, afterwards Mrs. Trumbull, who helped to keep her literary
      secrets, and assisted as much as she could in worrying the choleric
      Irishman. Mr. Francis, the editor, knew very well that Shields was "a
      fighting-man;" but the "pieces" sent him by the wicked ladies were so
      uncommonly rich in point and humor, that he yielded to a natural
      inclination, and printed them, one and all. Below we give a few specimens:&mdash;

      LETTER FROM THE LOST TOWNSHIPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost Townships, Aug. 27, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Printer,&mdash;I see you printed that long letter I sent you a
      spell ago: I'm quite encouraged by it, and can't keep from writing again.
      I think the printing of my letters will be a good thing all round,&mdash;it
      will give me the benefit of being known by the world, and give the world
      the advantage of knowing what's going on in the Lost Townships, and give
      your paper respectability besides. So here comes another. Yesterday
      afternoon I hurried through cleaning up the dinner-dishes, and stepped
      over to Neighbor S&mdash;&mdash;, to see if his wife Peggy was as well as
      mought be expected, and hear what they called the baby. Well, when I got
      there, and just turned round the corner of his log-cabin, there he was
      setting on the doorstep reading a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Jeff?" says I. He sorter started when he heard me, for he
      hadn't seen me before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," says he, "I'm mad as the devil, Aunt'Becca!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?" says I: "ain't its hair the right color? None of that
      nonsense, Jeff: there ain't an honester woman in the Lost Townships than"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Than who?" says he: "what the mischief are you about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to see I was running the wrong trail, and so says I, "Oh! nothing:
      I guess I was mistaken a little, that's all. But what is it you're mad
      about?" "Why," says he, "I've been tugging ever since harvest getting out
      wheat and hauling it to the river, to raise State-Bank paper enough to pay
      my tax this year, and a little school-debt I owe; and now, just as I've
      got it, here I open this infernal 'Extra Register,' expecting to find it
      full of 'Glorious Democratic Victories' and 'High-Comb'd Cocks,' when, lo
      and behold! I find a set of fellows calling themselves officers of State
      have forbidden the tax-collectors and school-commissioners to receive
      State paper at all; and so here it is, dead on my hands. I don't now
      believe all the plunder I've got will fetch ready cash enough to pay my
      taxes and that school-debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a good deal thunderstruck myself; for that was the first I had heard
      of the proclamation, and my old man was pretty much in the same fix with
      Jeff. We both stood a moment staring at one another, without knowing what
      to say. At last says I, "Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, let me look at that
      paper." He handed it to me, when I read the proclamation over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," says he, "did you ever see such a piece of impudence and
      imposition as that?" I saw Jeff was in a good tune for saying some
      ill-natured things, and so I tho't I would just argue a little on the
      contrary side, and make him rant a spell if I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," says I, looking as dignified and thoughtful as I could, "it seems
      pretty tough, to be sure, to have to raise silver where there's none to be
      raised; but then, you see, 'there will be danger of loss' if it ain't
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loss, damnation 1" says he. "I defy Daniel Webster, I defy King Solomon,
      I defy the world,&mdash;I defy&mdash;I defy&mdash;yes, I defy even you,
      Aunt'Becca, to show how the people can lose any thing by paying their
      taxes in State paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," says I, "you see what the officers of State say about it, and they
      are a desarnin' set of men. But," says I, "I guess you're mistaken about
      what the proclamation says. It don't say the people will lose any thing by
      the paper money being taken for taxes. It only says 'there will be danger
      of loss;' and though it is tolerable plain that the people can't lose by
      paying their taxes in something they can get easier than silver, instead
      of having to pay silver; and though it is just as plain that the State
      can't lose by taking State-Bank paper, however low it may be, while she
      owes the bank more than the whole revenue, and can pay that paper over on
      her debt, dollar for dollar,&mdash;still there is danger of loss to the
      'officers of State;' and you know, Jeff, we can't get along without
      officers of State."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn officers of State!" says he: "that's what you Whigs are always
      hurrahing for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't swear so, Jeff," says I: "you know I belong to the meetin',
      and swearin' hurts my feelins'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon, Aunt'Becca," says he; "but I do say it's enough to make Dr.
      Goddard swear, to have tax to pay in silver, for nothing only that Ford
      may get his two thousand a year, and Shields his twenty-four hundred a
      year, and Carpenter his sixteen hundred a year, and all without 'danger of
      loss' by taking it in State paper. Yes, yes: it's plain enough now what
      these officers of State mean by 'danger of loss.' Wash, I s'pose, actually
      lost fifteen hundred dollars out of the three thousand that two of these
      'officers of State' let him steal from the treasury, by being compelled to
      take it in State paper. Wonder if we don't have a proclamation before long
      commanding us to make up this loss to Wash in silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went on till his breath run out, and he had to stop. I couldn't
      think of any thing to say just then; and so I begun to look over the paper
      again. "Ay! here's another proclamation, or something like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another!" says Jeff; "and whose egg is it, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked to the bottom of it, and read aloud, "Your obedient servant, Jas.
      Shields, Auditor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" says Jeff, "one of them same three fellows again. Well, read it,
      and let's hear what of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I read on till I came to where it says, "The object of this measure is to
      suspend the collection of the revenue for the current year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now stop, now stop!" says he: "that's a lie a'ready, and I don't want to
      hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! maybe not," says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will
      the collectors, that have taken their oaths to make the collection, dare
      to suspend it? Is there any thing in the law requiring them to perjure
      themselves at the bidding of James Shields? Will the greedy gullet of the
      penitentiary be satisfied with swallowing him instead of all them, if they
      should venture to obey him? And would he not discover some 'danger of
      loss,' and be off, about the time it came to taking their places?
    </p>
    <p>
      "And suppose the people attempt to suspend, by refusing to pay, what then?
      The collectors would just jerk up their horses and cows, and the like, and
      sell them to the highest bidder for silver in hand, without valuation or
      redemption. Why, Shields didn't believe that story himself: it was never
      meant for the truth. If it was true, why was it not writ till five days
      after the proclamation? Why didn't Carlin and Carpenter sign it as well as
      Shields? Answer me that, Aunt'Becca. I say it's a lie, and not a well-told
      one at that. It grins out like a copper dollar. Shields is a fool as well
      as a liar. With him truth is out of the question; and, as for getting a
      good bright passable lie out of him, you might as well try to strike fire
      from a cake of tallow. I stick to it, it's all an infernal Whig lie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Whig lie! Highty tighty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a Whig lie; and it's just like every thing the cursed British Whigs
      do. First they'll do some divilment, and then they'll tell a lie to hide
      it. And they don't care how plain a lie it is: they think they can cram
      any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they call
      the Democrats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Jeff, you're crazy: you don't mean to say Shields is a Whig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Yes, I do."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, look here! the proclamation is in your own Democratic paper, as you
      call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it; and what of that? They only printed it to let us Democrats see
      the deviltry the Whigs are at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but Shields is the auditor of this Loco&mdash;I mean this
      Democratic State."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is, and Tyler appointed him to office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tyler appointed him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes (if you must chaw it over), Tyler appointed him; or, if it wasn't
      him, it was old Granny Harrison, and that's all one. I tell you,
      Aunt'Becca, there's no mistake about his being a Whig. Why, his very looks
      shows it,&mdash;every thing about him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, I
      could tell him by the smell. I seed him when I was down in Springfield
      last winter. They had a sort of a gatherin' there one night among the
      grandees, they called a fair. All the gals about town was there; and all
      the handsome widows and married women, finickin' about, trying to look
      like gals, tied as tight in the middle, and puffed out at both ends, like
      bundles of fodder that hadn't been stacked yet, but wanted stackin' pretty
      bad. And then they had tables all round the house kivered over with [ ]
      caps, and pincushions, and ten thousand such little knick-knacks, tryin'
      to sell'em to the fellows that were bowin' and scrapin' and kungeerin'
      about'em. They wouldn't let no Democrats in, for fear they'd disgust the
      ladies, or scare the little gals, or dirty the floor. I looked in at the
      window, and there was this same fellow Shields floatin' about on the air,
      without heft or earthly substance, just like a lock of cat-fur where cats
      had been fightin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was paying his money to this one, and that one, and t'other one, and
      sufferin' great loss because it wasn't silver instead of State paper; and
      the sweet distress he seemed to be in,&mdash;his very features, in the
      ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, 'Dear girls, it
      is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how much you
      suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and
      so interesting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face, he
      seized hold of one of their hands, and squeezed, and held on to it about a
      quarter of an hour. 'O my good fellow!' says I to myself, 'if that was one
      of our Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you'd get a brass
      pin let into you, would be about up to the head.' He a Democrat!
      Fiddlesticks! I tell you, Aunt'Becca, he's a Whig, and no mistake: nobody
      but a Whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," says I, "maybe he is; but, if he is, I'm mistaken the worst sort.
      Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I'll suffer by it; I'll be a Democrat if
      it turns out that Shields is a Whig; considerin' you shall be a Whig if he
      turns out a Democrat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bargain, by jingoes!" says he; "but how will we find out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," says I, "we'll just write, and ax the printer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed again!" says he; "and, by thunder! if it does turn out that
      Shields is a Democrat, I never will"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jefferson,&mdash;Jefferson"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want, Peggy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do get through your everlasting clatter sometime, and bring me a gourd of
      water: the child's been crying for a drink this live-long hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it die, then: it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to
      fatten officers of State."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff run off to get the water, though, just like he hadn't been sayin' any
      thing spiteful; for he's a raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once you
      get at the foundation of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked into the house, and "Why, Peggy," says I, "I declare, we like to
      forgot you altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" says she, "when a body can't help themselves, everybody soon
      forgets'em; but, thank God! by day after to-morrow I shall be well enough
      to milk the cows, and pen the calves, and wring the contrary ones' tails
      for'em, and no thanks to nobody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening, Peggy," says I; and so I sloped, for I seed she was mad at
      me for making Jeff neglect her so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Mr. Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper
      whether this Shields is a Whig or a Democrat? I don't care about it for
      myself, for I know well enough how it is already; but I want to convince
      Jeff. It may do some good to let him, and others like him, know who and
      what those officers of State are. It may help to send the present
      hypocritical set to where they belong, and to fill the places they now
      disgrace with men who will do more work for less pay, and take a fewer
      airs while they are doing it. It ain't sensible to think that the same men
      who get us into trouble will change their course; and yet it's pretty
      plain, if some change for the better is not made, it's not long that
      either Peggy or I, or any of us, will have a cow left to milk, or a calf's
      tail to wring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost Townships, Sept. 8,1842. Dear Mr. Printer,&mdash;I was a-standin' at
      the spring yesterday a-washin' out butter, when I seed Jim Snooks a-ridin'
      up towards the house for very life like, when, jist as I was a wonderin'
      what on airth was the matter with him, he stops suddenly, and ses he,
      "Aunt'Becca, here's somethin' for you;" and with that he hands out your
      letter. Well, you see I steps out towards him, not thinkin' that I had
      both hands full of butter; and seein' I couldn't take the letter, you
      know, without greasin' it, I ses, "Jim, jist you open it, and read it for
      me." Well, Jim opens it, and reads it; and would you believe it, Mr.
      Editor? I was so completely dumfounded, and turned into stone, that there
      I stood in the sun, a-workin' the butter, and it a-runnin' on the ground,
      while he read the letter, that I never thunk what I was about till the
      hull on't run melted on the ground, and was lost. Now, sir, it's not for
      the butter, nor the price of the butter, but, the Lord have massy on us, I
      wouldn't have sich another fright for a whole firkin of it. Why, when I
      found out that it was the man what Jeff seed down to the fair that had
      demanded the author of my letters, threatnin' to take personal
      satisfaction of the writer, I was so skart that I tho't I should
      quill-wheel right where I was.

      You say that Mr. S. is offended at being compared to cat's fur, and is as
      mad as a March hare (that ain't far), because I told about the squeezin'.
      Now, I want you to tell Mr. S, that, rather than fight, I'll make any
      apology; and, if he wants personal satisfaction, let him only come here,
      and he may squeeze my hand as hard as I squeeze the butter, and, if that
      ain't personal satisfaction, I can only say that he is the fust man that
      was not satisfied with squeezin' my hand. If this should not answer, there
      is one thing more that I would do rather than get a lickin'. I have all
      along expected to die a widow; but, as Mr. S. is rather good-looking than
      otherwise, I must say I don't care if we compromise the matter by&mdash;really,
      Mr. Printer, I can't help blushin'&mdash;but I&mdash;it must come out&mdash;I&mdash;but
      widowed modesty&mdash;well, if I must, I must&mdash;wouldn't he&mdash;maybe
      sorter, let the old grudge drap if I was to consent to be&mdash;be&mdash;h-i-s
      w-i-f-e? I know he's a fightin' man, and would rather fight than eat; but
      isn't marryin' better than fightin', though it does sometimes run into it?
      And I don't think, upon the whole, that I'd be sich a bad match neither:
      I'm not over sixty, and am just four feet three in my bare feet, and not
      much more round the girth; and for color, I wouldn't turn my back to nary
      gal in the Lost Townships. But, after all, maybe I'm countin' my chickins
      before they' re hatched, and dreamin' of matrimonial bliss when the only
      alternative reserved for me may be a lickin'. Jeff tells me the way these
      fire-eaters do is to give the challenged party choice of weapons, &amp;c.,
      which bein' the case, I'll tell you in confidence that I never fights with
      any thing but broomsticks, or hot water, or a shovelful of coals, or some
      such thing; the former of which being somewhat like a shillalah, may not
      be very objectionable to him. I will give him choice, however, in one
      thing, and that is, whether, when we fight, I shall wear breeches or he
      petticoats; for I presume that change is sufficient to place us on an
      equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;Jist say to your friend, if he concludes to marry rather than
      fight, I shall only inforce one condition: that is, if he should ever
      happen to gallant any young gals home of nights from our house, he must
      not squeeze their hands.

      It is by no means a subject of wonder that these publications threw Mr.
      James Shields into a state of wrath. A thin-skinned, sensitive,
      high-minded, and high-tempered man, tender of his honor, and an Irishman
      besides, it would have been strange indeed, if he had not felt like
      snuffing blood. But his rage only afforded new delights to his tormentors;
      and when it reached its height, "Aunt'Becca" transformed herself to
      "Cathleen," and broke out in rhymes like the following, which Miss Jayne's
      brother "Bill" kindly consented to "drop" for the amiable ladies.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [For The Journal.] Ye Jew's-harps awake! The A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s
        won: Rebecca the widow has gained Erin's son; The pride of the North
        from Emerald Isle Has been wooed and won by a woman's smile. The
        combat's relinquished, old loves all forgot: To the widow he's bound.
        Oh, bright be his lot! In the smiles of the conquest so lately achieved,
        Joyful be his bride, "widowed modesty" relieved. The footsteps of time
        tread lightly on flowers, May the cares of this world ne'er darken his
        hours! But the pleasures of life are fickle and coy As the smiles of a
        maiden sent off to destroy. Happy groom! in sadness, far distant from
        thee, The Fair girls dream only of past times of glee Enjoyed in thy
        presence; whilst the soft blarnied store Will be fondly remembered as
        relics of yore, And hands that in rapture you oft would have prest In
        prayer will be clasped that your lot may be blest. Cathleen.

      It was too bad. Mr. Shields could stand it no longer. He sent Gen.
      Whiteside to Mr. Francis, to demand the name of the person who wrote the
      letters from the "Lost Townships;" and Mr. Francis told him it was <i>A.
      Lincoln</i>. This information led to a challenge, a sudden scampering off
      of parties and friends to Missouri, a meeting, an explanation, and a
      peaceful return.

      Abraham Lincoln in the field of honor, sword in hand, manoeuvred by a
      second learned in the <i>duello</i>, would be an attractive spectacle
      under any circumstances. But with a celebrated man for an antagonist, and
      a lady's humor the occasion, the scene is one of transcendent interest;
      and the documents which describe it are well entitled to a place in his
      history. The letter of Mr. Shields's second, being first in date, is first
      in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Oct. 3, 1842. To the Editor op "The Sangamon Journal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;To prevent misrepresentation of the recent affair between
      Messrs. Shields and Lincoln, I think it proper to give a brief narrative
      of the facts of the case, as they came within my knowledge; for the truth
      of which I hold myself responsible, and request you to give the same
      publication. An offensive article in relation to Mr. Shields appeared in
      "The Sangamon Journal" of the 2d September last; and, on demanding the
      author, Mr. Lincoln was given up by the editor. Mr. Shields, previous to
      this demand, made arrangements to go to Quincy on public business; and
      before his return Mr. Lincoln had left for Tremont, to attend the court,
      with the intention, as we learned, of remaining on the circuit several
      weeks. Mr. Shields, on his return, requested me to accompany him to
      Tremont; and, on arriving there, we found that Dr. Merryman and Mr. Butler
      had passed us in the night, and got there before us. We arrived in Tremont
      on the 17th ult.; and Mr. Shields addressed a note to Mr. Lincoln
      immediately, informing him that he was given up as the author of some
      articles that appeared in "The Sangamon Journal" (one more over the
      signature having made its appearance at this time), and requesting him to
      <i>retract</i> the offensive allusions contained in said articles in
      relation to his private character. Mr. Shields handed this note to me to
      deliver to Mr. Lincoln, and directed me, at the same time, not to enter
      into any verbal communication, or be the bearer of any verbal explanation,
      as such were always liable to misapprehension. This note was delivered by
      me to Mr. Lincoln, stating, at the same time, that I would call at his
      convenience for an answer. Mr. Lincoln, in the evening of the same day,
      handed me a letter addressed to Mr. Shields. In this he gave or offered no
      explanation, but stated therein that he could not submit to answer
      further, on the ground that Shields's note contained an assumption of
      facts and also a menace. Mr. Shields then addressed him another note, in
      which he disavowed all intention to menace, and requested to know whether
      he (Mr. Lincoln) was the author of either of the articles which appeared
      in "The Journal," headed "Lost Townships," and signed "Rebecca;" and, if
      so, he repeated his request of a retraction of the offensive matter in
      relation to his private character; if not, his denial would be held
      sufficient. This letter was returned to Mr. Shields unanswered, with a
      verbal statement "that there could be no further negotiation between them
      until the first note was withdrawn." Mr. Shields thereupon sent a note
      designating me as his friend, to which Mr. Lincoln replied by designating
      Dr. Merryman. These three last notes passed on Monday morning, the 19th.
      Dr. Merryman handed me Mr. Lincoln's last note when by ourselves. I
      remarked to Dr. Merryman that the matter was now submitted to us, and that
      I would propose that he and myself should pledge our words of honor to
      each other to try to agree upon terms of amicable arrangement, and compel
      our principals to accept of them. To this he readily assented, and we
      shook hands upon the pledge. It was then mutually agreed that we should
      adjourn to Springfield, and there procrastinate the matter, for the
      purpose of effecting the secret arrangement between him and myself. All
      this I kept concealed from Mr. Shields. Our horse had got a little lame in
      going to Tremont, and Dr. Merryman invited me to take a seat in his buggy.
      I accepted the invitation the more readily, as I thought, that leaving Mr.
      Shields in Tremont until his horse would be in better condition to travel
      would facilitate the private agreement between Dr. Merryman and myself. I
      travelled to Springfield part of the way with him, and part with Mr.
      Lincoln; but nothing passed between us on the journey in relation to the
      matter in hand. We arrived in Springfield on Monday night. About noon on
      Tuesday, to my astonishment, a proposition was made to meet in Missouri,
      within three miles of Alton, on the next Thursday! The weapons, cavalry
      broadswords of the largest size; the parties to stand on each side of a
      barrier, and to be confined to a limited space. As I had not been
      consulted at all on the subject, and considering the private understanding
      between Dr. Merryman and myself, and it being known that Mr. Shields was
      left at Tremont, such a proposition took me by surprise. However, being
      determined not to violate the laws of the State, I declined agreeing upon
      the terms until we should meet in Missouri. Immediately after, I called
      upon Dr. Merryman, and withdrew the pledge of honor between him and myself
      in relation to a secret arrangement. I started after this to meet Mr.
      Shields, and met him about twenty miles from Springfield. It was late on
      Tuesday night when we both reached the city, and learned that Dr. Merryman
      had left for Missouri, Mr. Lincoln having left before the proposition was
      made, as Dr. Merryman had himself informed me. The time and place made it
      necessary to start at once. We left Springfield at eleven o'clock on
      Tuesday night, travelled all night, and arrived in Hillsborough on
      Wednesday morning, where we took in Gen. Ewing. From there we went to
      Alton, where we arrived on Thursday; and, as the proposition required
      three friends on each side, I was joined by Gen. Ewing and Dr. Hope, as
      the friends of Mr. Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then crossed to Missouri, where a proposition was made by Gen. Hardin
      and Dr. English (who had arrived there in the mean time as mutual friends)
      to refer the matter to, I think, four friends for a settlement. This I
      believed Mr. Shields would refuse, and declined seeing him; but Dr. Hope,
      who conferred with him upon the subject, returned, and stated that Mr.
      Shields declined settling the matter through any other than the friends he
      had selected to stand by him on that occasion. The friends of both the
      parties finally agreed to withdraw the papers (temporarily) to give the
      friends of Mr. Lincoln an opportunity to explain. Whereupon the friends of
      Mr. Lincoln, to wit, Messrs. Merryman, Bledsoe, and Butler, made a full
      and satisfactory explanation in relation to the article which appeared in
      "The Sangamon Journal" of the 2d, the only one written by him. This was
      all done without the knowledge or consent of Mr. Shields; and he refused
      to accede to it until Dr. Hope, Gen. Ewing, and myself declared the
      apology sufficient, and that we could not sustain him in going further. I
      think it necessary to state further, that no explanation or apology had
      been previously offered on the part of Mr. Lincoln to Mr. Shields, and
      that none was ever communicated by me to him, nor was any ever offered to
      me, unless a paper read to me by Dr. Merryman after he had handed me the
      broadsword proposition on Tuesday. I heard so little of the reading of the
      paper, that I do not know fully what it purported to be; and I was the
      less inclined to inquire, as Mr. Lincoln was then gone to Missouri, and
      Mr. Shields not yet arrived from Tremont. In fact, I could not entertain
      any offer of the kind, unless upon my own responsibility; and that I was
      not disposed to do after what had already transpired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this statement, as I am about to be absent for some time, and I
      think it due to all concerned to give a true version of the matter before
      I leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      John D. Whiteside.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Mr. Merryman replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Oct. 8, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Editors of "The Journal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gents,&mdash;By your paper of Friday, I discover that Gen. Whiteside has
      published his version of the late affair between Messrs. Shields and
      Lincoln. I now bespeak a hearing of my version of the same affair, which
      shall be true and full as to all material facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday evening, the 16th of September, I learned that Mr. Shields and
      Gen. Whiteside had started in pursuit of Mr. Lincoln, who was at Tremont,
      attending court. I knew that Mr. Lincoln was wholly unpractised both as to
      the diplomacy and weapons commonly employed in similar affairs; and I felt
      it my duty, as a friend, to be with him, and, so far as in my power, to
      prevent any advantage being taken of him as to either his honor or his
      life. Accordingly, Mr. Butler and myself started, passed Shields and
      Whiteside in the night, and arrived at Tremont ahead of them on Saturday
      morning. I told Mr. Lincoln what was brewing, and asked him what course he
      proposed to himself. He stated that he was wholly opposed to duelling, and
      would do any thing to avoid it that might not degrade him in the
      estimation of himself and friends; but, if such degradation or a fight
      were the only alternative, he would fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Shields and Whiteside arrived, and very soon the former
      sent to Mr. Lincoln by the latter the following note or letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremont, Sept. 17,1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln, Esq.&mdash;I regret that my absence on public business
      compelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little longer
      than I could have desired. It will only be necessary, however, to account
      for it by informing you that I have been to Quincy on business that would
      not admit of delay. I will now state briefly the reasons of my troubling
      you with this communication, the disagreeable nature of which I regret, as
      I had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in Springfield while
      residing there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a way amongst
      both my political friends and opponents, as to escape the necessity of
      any. Whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation, I have become the
      object of slander, vituperation, and personal abuse, which, were I capable
      of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy of the whole of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two or three of the last number's of "The Sangamon Journal," articles
      of the most personal nature, and calculated to degrade me, have made their
      appearance. On inquiring, I was informed by the editor of that paper,
      through the medium of my friend, Gen. Whiteside, that you are the author
      of those articles. This information satisfies me that I have become, by
      some means or other, the object of your secret hostility. I will not take
      the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this; but I will take the
      liberty of requiring a full, positive, and absolute retraction of all
      offensive allusions used by you in these communications, in relation to my
      private character and standing as a man, as an apology for the insults
      conveyed in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ob't serv't,
    </p>
    <p>
      [Copy.] Jas. Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      About sunset Gen. Whiteside called again, and received from Mr. Lincoln
      the following answer to Mr. Shields's note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremont, Sept. 17, 1812
    </p>
    <p>
      Jas. Shields, Esq.&mdash;Your note of to-day was handed me by Gen.
      Whiteside. In that note, you say you have been informed, through the
      medium of the editor of "The Journal," that I am the author of certain
      articles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you; and,
      without stopping to inquire whether I really am the author, or to point
      out what is offensive in them, you demand an unqualified retraction of all
      that is offensive, and then proceed to hint at consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts, and so much of
      menace as to consequences, that I cannot submit to answer that note any
      further than I have, and to add, that the consequence to which I suppose
      you allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could
      to you. Respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour Gen. Whiteside called again with another note from Mr.
      Shields; but after conferring with Mr. Butler for a long time, say two or
      three hours, returned without presenting the note to Mr. Lincoln. This was
      in consequence of an assurance from Mr. Butler that Mr. Lincoln could not
      receive any communication from Mr. Shields, unless it were a withdrawal of
      his first note, or a challenge. Mr. Butler further stated to Gen.
      Whiteside, that, on the withdrawal of the first note, and a proper and
      gentlemanly request for an explanation, he had no doubt one would be
      given. Gen. Whiteside admitted that that was the course Mr. Shields ought
      to pursue, but deplored that his furious and intractable temper prevented
      his having any influence with him to that end. Gen. W. then requested us
      to wait with him until Monday morning, that he might endeavor to bring Mr.
      Shields to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning he called and presented Mr. Lincoln the same note as,
      Mr. Butler says, he had brought on Saturday evening. It was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremont, Sept. 17, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln, Esq.&mdash;In your reply to my note of this date, you intimate
      that I assume facts and menace consequences, and that you cannot submit to
      answer it further. As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little more
      particular. The editor of "The Sangamon Journal" gave me to understand
      that you are the author of an article which appeared, I think, in that
      paper of the 2d September inst., headed "The Lost Townships," and signed
      Rebecca or 'Becca. I would therefore take the liberty of asking whether
      you are the author of said article, or any other over the same signature
      which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper. If so, I
      repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusion
      contained therein in relation to my private character and standing. If you
      are not the author of any of the articles, your denial will be sufficient.
      I will say further, it is not my intention to menace, but to do myself
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ob't serv't,
    </p>
    <p>
      [Copy.] Jas. Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Mr. Lincoln perused, and returned to Gen. Whiteside, telling him
      verbally, that he did not think it consistent with his honor to negotiate
      for peace with Mr. Shields, unless Mr. Shields would withdraw his former
      offensive letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very short time Gen. Whiteside called with a note from Mr. Shields,
      designating Gen. Whiteside as his friend, to which Mr. Lincoln instantly
      replied, designating me as his. On meeting Gen. Whiteside, he proposed
      that we should pledge our honor to each other that we would endeavor to
      settle the matter amicably; to which I agreed, and stated to him the only
      conditions on which it could be so settled; viz., the withdrawal of Mr.
      Shields's first note; which he appeared to think reasonable, and regretted
      that the note had been written,&mdash;saying, however, that he had
      endeavored to prevail on Mr. Shields to write a milder one, but had not
      succeeded. He added, too, that I must promise not to mention it, as he
      would not dare to let Mr. Shields know that he was negotiating peace; for,
      said he, "He would challenge me next, and as soon cut my throat as not."
      Not willing that he should suppose my principal less dangerous than his
      own, I promised not to mention our pacific intentions to Mr. Lincoln or
      any other person; and we started for Springfield forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all, except Mr. Shields, arrived in Springfield late at night on
      Monday. We discovered that the affair had, somehow, got great publicity in
      Springfield, and that an arrest was probable. To prevent this, it was
      agreed by Mr. Lincoln and myself that he should leave early on Tuesday
      morning. Accordingly, he prepared the following instructions for my guide,
      on a suggestion from Mr. Butler that he had reason to believe that an
      attempt would be made by the opposite party to have the matter
      accommodated:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In case Whiteside shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without
      further difficulty, let him know, that, if the present papers be
      withdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields asking to know if I am the author
      of the articles of which he complains, and asking that I shall make him
      gentlemanly satisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace or
      dictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is made that the
      following answer shall be given:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did write the 'Lost Township' letter which appeared in the 'Journal' of
      the 2d inst., but had no participation in any form in any other article
      alluding to you. I wrote that wholly for political effect. I had no
      intention of injuring your personal or private character, or standing as a
      man or a gentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think, that
      that article could produce, or has produced, that effect against you; and,
      had I anticipated such an effect, would have forborne to write it. And I
      will add, that your conduct towards me, so far as I knew, had always been
      gentlemanly, and that I had no personal pique against you, and no cause
      for any."
    </p>
    <p>
      If this should be done, I leave it with you to manage what shall and what
      shall not be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      If nothing like this is done, the preliminaries of the fight are to be:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1st, Weapons.&mdash;Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely
      equal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry company at
      Jacksonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      2d, Position.&mdash;A plank ten feet long, and from nine to twelve inches
      broad, to be firmly fixed on edge on the ground as the line between us,
      which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life. Next, a
      line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and parallel with
      it, each at the distance of the whole length of the sword and three feet
      additional from the plank; and the passing of his own such line by either
      party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender of the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d, Time.&mdash;On Thursday evening at 5 o'clock, if you can get it so;
      but in no case to be at a greater distance of time than Friday evening at
      5 o'clock.

      In the course of the forenoon I met Gen. Whiteside, and he again intimated
      a wish to adjust the matter amicably. I then read to him Mr. Lincoln's
      instructions to an adjustment, and the terms of the hostile meeting, if
      there must be one, both at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that it was useless to talk of an adjustment, if it could only
      be effected by the <i>withdrawal</i> of Mr. Shields's paper, for such
      withdrawal Mr. Shields would never consent to; adding, that he would as
      soon think of asking Mr. Shields to "butt his brains out against a brick
      wall as to withdraw that paper." He proceeded: "I see but one course,&mdash;that
      is a desperate remedy:'tis to tell them, if they will not make the matter
      up, they must fight us." I replied, that, if he chose to fight Mr. Shields
      to compel him to do right, he might do so; but as for Mr. Lincoln, he was
      on the defensive, and, I believed, in the right, and I should do nothing
      to compel him to do wrong. Such withdrawal having been made indispensable
      by Mr. Lincoln, I cut this matter short as to an adjustment, an I proposed
      to Gan. Whiteside to accept the terms of the fight, which he refused to do
      until Mr. Shields's arrival in town, but agreed, verbally, that Mr.
      Lincoln's friends should procure the broadswords, and take them to the
      ground. In the afternoon he came to me, saying that some persons were
      swearing out affidavits to have us arrested, and that he intended to meet
      Mr. Shields immediately, and proceed to the place designated; lamenting,
      however, that I would not delay the time, that he might procure the
      interference of Gov. Ford and Gen. Ewing to mollify Mr. Shields. I told
      him that an accommodation, except upon the terms I mentioned, was out of
      the question; that to delay the meeting was to facilitate our arrest; and,
      as I was determined not to be arrested, I should leave town in fifteen
      minutes. I then pressed his acceptance of the preliminaries, which he
      disclaimed upon the ground that it would interfere with his oath of office
      as Fund Commissioner. I then, with two other friends, went to
      Jacksonville, where we joined Mr. Lincoln about 11 o'clock on Tuesday
      night. Wednesday morning we procured the broadswords, and proceeded to
      Alton, where we arrived about 11, A.M., on Thursday. The other party were
      in town before us. We crossed the river, and they soon followed. Shortly
      after, Gen. Hardin and Dr. English presented to Gen. Whiteside and myself
      the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alton, Sept. 22, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Whiteside and Merryman.&mdash;As the mutual personal friends of
      Messrs. Shields and Lincoln, but without authority from either, we
      earnestly desire to see a reconciliation of the misunderstanding which
      exists between them. Such difficulties should always be arranged amicably,
      if it is possible to do so with honor to both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing ourselves, that such an arrangement can possibly be effected, we
      respectfully, but earnestly, submit the following proposition for your
      consideration:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the whole difficulty be submitted to four or more gentlemen, to be
      selected by yourselves, who shall consider the affair, and report
      thereupon for your consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      John J. Hardin.
    </p>
    <p>
      E. W. English.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this proposition Gen. Whiteside agreed: I declined doing so without
      consulting Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln remarked, that, as they had accepted
      the proposition, he would do so, but directed that his friends should make
      no terms except those first proposed. Whether the adjustment was finally
      made upon these very terms, and no other, let the following documents
      attest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Missouri, Sept. 22, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen,&mdash;All papers in relation to the matter in controversy
      between Mr. Shields and Mr. Lincoln having been withdrawn by the friends
      of the parties concerned, the friends of Mr. Shields ask the friends of
      Mr. Lincoln to explain all offensive matter in the articles which appeared
      in "The Sangamon Journal" of the 2d, 9th, and 16th of September, under the
      signature of "Rebecca," and headed "Lost Townships."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due to Gen. Hardin and Mr. English to state that their interference
      was of the most courteous and gentlemanly character.
    </p>

      Missouri, Sept. 22, 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen,&mdash;All papers in relation to the matter in controversy
      between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Shields having been withdrawn by the friends
      of the parties concerned, we, the undersigned, friends of Mr. Lincoln, in
      accordance with your request that explanation of Mr. Lincoln's publication
      in relation to Mr. Shields in "The Sangamon Journal" of the 2d, 9th, and
      16th of September be made, take pleasure in saying, that, although Mr.
      Lincoln was the writer of the article signed "Rebecca" in the "Journal" of
      the 2d, and that only, yet he had no intention of injuring the personal or
      private character or standing of Mr. Shields as a gentleman or a man, and
      that Mr. Lincoln did not think, nor does he now think, that said article
      could produce such an effect; and, had Mr. Lincoln anticipated such an
      effect, he would have forborne to write it. We will further state, that
      said article was written solely for political effect, and not to gratify
      any personal pique against Mr. Shields, for he had none, and knew of no
      cause for any It is due to Gen. Hanlin and Mr. English to say that their
      interference was of the most courteous and gentlemanly character.
    </p>
    <p>
      E. H. Merryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. T. Bledsoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wm. Butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be observed now, that Mr. Shields's friends, after agreeing to the
      arbitrament of four disinterested gentlemen, declined the contract, saying
      that Mr. Shields wished his own friends to act for him. They then proposed
      that we should explain without any withdrawal of papers. This was promptly
      and firmly refused, and Gen. Whiteside himself pronounced the papers
      withdrawn. They then produced a note requesting us to "<i>disavow</i>" all
      offensive intentions in the publications, &amp;c., &amp;c. This we
      declined answering, and only responded to the above request for an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the material facts in relation to the matter, and I think
      present the case in a very different light from the garbled and curtailed
      statement of Gen. Whiteside. Why he made that statement I know not, unless
      he wished to detract from the honor of Mr. Lincoln. This was ungenerous,
      more particularly as he on the ground requested us not to make in our
      explanation any quotations from the "Rebecca papers;" also not to make <i>public
      the terms of reconciliation</i>, and to unite with them in defending the
      honorable character of the adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gen. W., in his publication, says, "The friends of both parties agreed to
      withdraw the papers (temporarily) to give the friends of Mr. Lincoln an
      opportunity to explain." This I deny. I say the papers were withdrawn to
      enable Mr. Shields's friends to <i>ask</i> an explanation; and I appeal to
      the documents for proof of my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      By looking over these documents, it will be seen that Mr. Shields had not
      before asked for an <i>explanation</i>, but had all the time been
      dictatorily insisting on a <i>retraction</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gen. Whiteside, in his communication, brings to light much of Mr.
      Shields's manifestations of bravery behind the scenes. I can do nothing of
      the kind for Mr. Lincoln. He took his stand when I first met him at
      Tremont, and maintained it <i>calmly</i> to the last, without difficulty
      or difference between himself and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot close this article, lengthy as it is, without testifying to the
      honorable and gentlemanly conduct of Gen. Ewing and Dr. Hope, nor indeed
      can I say that I saw any thing objectionable in the course of Gen.
      Whiteside up to the time of his communication. This is so replete with
      prevarication and misrepresentation, that I cannot accord to the General
      that candor which I once supposed him to possess. He complains that I did
      not procrastinate time according to agreement. He forgets that by his own
      act he cut me off from that chance in inducing me, by promise, not to
      communicate our secret contract to Mr. Lincoln. Moreover, I could see no
      consistency in wishing for an extension of time at that stage of the
      affair, when in the outset they were in so precipitate a hurry, that they
      could not wait three days for Mr. Lincoln to return from Tremont, but must
      hasten there, apparently with the intention of bringing the matter to a
      speedy issue. He complains, too, that, after inviting him to take a seat
      in my buggy, I never broached the subject to him on our route here. But
      was I, the defendant in the case, with a challenge hanging over me, to
      make advances, and beg a reconciliation? Absurd! Moreover, the valorous
      general forgets that he beguiled the tedium of the journey by recounting
      to me his exploits in many a well-fought battle,&mdash;dangers by "flood
      and field" in which I don't believe he ever participated,&mdash;doubtless
      with a view to produce a salutary effect on my nerves, and impress me with
      a proper notion of his fire-eating propensities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more main point of his argument, and I have done. The General seems to
      be troubled with a convenient shortness of memory on some occasions. He
      does not remember that any explanations were offered at any time, unless
      it were a paper read when the "broadsword proposition" was tendered, when
      his mind was so confused by the anticipated clatter of broadswords, or <i>something
      else</i>, that he did "not know fully what it purported to be." The truth
      is, that by unwisely refraining from mentioning it to his principal, he
      placed himself in a dilemma which he is now endeavoring to shuffle out of.
      By his inefficiency, and want of knowledge of those laws which govern
      gentlemen in matters of this kind, he has done great injustice to his
      principal, a gentleman who I believe is ready at all times to vindicate
      his honor manfully, but who has been unfortunate in the selection of his
      friend; and this fault he is now trying to wipe out by doing an act of
      still greater injustice to Mr. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      E. H. Merryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Mr. Lincoln acknowledged himself to have been the author of one of
      the "Lost Township Letters." Whether he was or not, was known only perhaps
      to Miss Todd and himself. At the time of their date, he was having secret
      meetings with her at Mr. Francis's house, and endeavoring to nerve himself
      to the duty of marrying her, with what success the letters to Speed are
      abundant evidence. It is probable that Mary composed them fresh from these
      stolen conferences; that some of Mr. Lincoln's original conceptions and
      peculiarities of style unwittingly crept into them, and that here and
      there he altered and amended the manuscript before it went to the printer.
      Such a connection with a lady's productions made it obligatory upon him to
      defend them. But why avow one, and disavow the rest? It is more than
      likely that he was determined to take just enough responsibility to fight
      upon, provided Shields should prove incorrigible, and not enough to
      prevent a peaceful issue, if the injured gentleman should be inclined to
      accept an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his marriage, Mr. Lincoln took up his residence at the "Globe
      Tavern," where he had a room and boarding for man and wife for the
      moderate sum of four dollars per week. But, notwithstanding cheap living,
      he was still as poor as ever, and gave "poverty" as one of his reasons for
      not paying a friendly visit which seemed to be expected of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bar and in political affairs he continued to work with as much
      energy as before, although his political prospects seem just now to have
      suffered an unexpected eclipse. In 1843, Lincoln, Hardin, and Baker were
      candidates for the Whig congressional nomination; but between Hardin and
      Baker there was "bitter hostility," and between Baker and Lincoln
      "suspicion and dislike." The contest was long and fierce; but, before it
      was over, Lincoln reluctantly withdrew in favor of Baker. He had had a
      hard time of it, and had been compelled to meet accusations of a very
      strange character. Among other things, he was charged with being an
      aristocrat; with having deserted his old friends, the people, by marrying
      a proud woman on account of her blood and family. This hurt him keenly,
      and he took great pains to disprove it; but this was not all. He was
      called an infidel by some, a Presbyterian here, an Episcopalian there; so
      that by turns he incurred the hostility of all the most powerful religious
      societies in the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 24th of March, he wrote to Mr. Speed as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, March 24, 1843.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;... We had a meeting of the Whigs of the county here on
      last Monday to appoint delegates to a district convention; and Baker beat
      me, and got the delegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite
      of my attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates; so that,
      in getting Baker the nomination, I shall be fixed a good deal like a
      fellow who is made a groomsman to a man that has cut him out, and is
      marrying his own dear "gal." About the prospects of your having a namesake
      at our town, can't say exactly yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now a Baker delegate, pledged to get him the nomination if he
      could; and yet he was far from giving up the contest in his own behalf.
      Only two days after the letter to Speed, he wrote to Mr. Morris:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Ill., March 26, 1843.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friend Morris,&mdash;Your letter of the 23d was received on yesterday
      morning, and for which (instead of an excuse, which you thought proper to
      ask) I tender you my sincere thanks. It is truly gratifying to me to
      learn, that, while the people of Sangamon have cast me off, my old friends
      of Menard, who have known me longest and best, stick to me. It would
      astonish, if not amuse, the older citizens (a stranger, friendless,
      uneducated, penniless boy, working on a flat-boat at ten dollars per
      month) to learn that I have been put down here as the candidate of pride,
      wealth, and aristocratic family distinction. Yet so, chiefly, it was.
      There was, too, the strangest combination of church-influence against me.
      Baker is a Campbellite; and therefore, as I suppose, with few exceptions,
      got all that church.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some with the
      Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would tell, I was set down
      as either the one or the other, while it was everywhere contended that no
      Christian ought to go for me, because I belonged to no church, was
      suspected of being a deist, and had talked about fighting a duel. With all
      these things, Baker, of course, had nothing to do. Nor do I complain of
      them. As to his own church going for him, I think that was right enough:
      and as to the influences I have spoken of in the other, though they were
      very strong, it would be grossly untrue and unjust to charge that they
      acted upon them in a body, or were very near so. I only mean that those
      influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent upon my strength
      throughout the religious controversy. But enough of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, that, in choosing a candidate for Congress, you have an equal
      right with Sangamon; and in this you are undoubtedly earnest. In agreeing
      to withdraw if the Whigs of Sangamon should go against me, I did not mean
      that they alone were worth consulting, but that if she, with her heavy
      delegation, should be against me, it would be impossible for me to
      succeed; and therefore I had as well decline. And in relation to Menard
      having rights, permit me fully to recognize them, and to express the
      opinion, that, if she and Mason act circumspectly, they will in the
      convention be able so far to enforce their rights as to decide absolutely
      which <i>one</i> of the candidates shall be successful. Let me show the
      reason of this. Hardin, or some other Morgan candidate, will get Putnam,
      Marshall, Woodford, Tazewell, and Logan,&mdash;make sixteen. Then you and
      Mason, having three, can give the victory to either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say you shall instruct your delegates for me, unless I object. I
      certainly shall not object. That would be too pleasant a compliment for me
      to tread in the dust. And besides, if any thing should happen (which,
      however, is not probable) by which Baker should be thrown out of the
      fight, I would be at liberty to accept the nomination if I could get it. I
      do, however, feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from getting
      the nomination. I should despise myself were I to attempt it. I think,
      then, it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three delegates, and
      to instruct them to go for some one as a first choice, some one else as a
      second, and perhaps some one as a third; and, if in those instructions I
      were named as the first choice, it would gratify me very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to hold the balance of power, it is important for you to
      attend to and secure the vote of Mason also. You should be sure to have
      men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in. If
      yourself and James Short were appointed for your county, all would be
      safe; but whether Jim's woman affair a year ago might not be in the way of
      his appointment is a question. I don't know whether you know it, but I
      know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world. You have my
      permission, and even request, to show this letter to Short; but to no one
      else, unless it be a very particular friend, who you know will not speak
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;Will you write me again?

      To Martin M. Morris, Petersburg, 111.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally to Speed on the same subject:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, May 18, 1843.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;Yours of the 9th inst. is duly received, which I do not
      meet as a "bore," but as a most welcome visitor. I will answer the
      business part of it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      In relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I
      would support the nominee. Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but
      Hardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances. We shall have no
      split or trouble about the matter,&mdash;all will be harmony. In relation
      to the "coming events" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one
      word before I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the
      judgment of a Butler on such a subject, that I incline to think there may
      be some reality in it. What day does Butler appoint? By the way, how do
      "events" of the same sort come on in your family? Are you possessing
      houses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants,
      and begetting sons and daughters? We are not keeping house, but boarding
      at the Globe Tavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the
      name of Beck. Our room (the same Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding
      only costs us four dollars a week. Ann Todd was married something more
      than a year since to a fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says,
      is pretty much of a "dunce," though he has a little money and property.
      They live in Boonville, Mo., and have not been heard from lately enough
      for me to say any thing about her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in
      our power to visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the necessity
      of attending to business, those "coming events," I suspect, would be
      somewhat in the way. I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not
      fail to come. Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided
      for you at our house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to
      give my respects to your mother and family: assure her, that, if I ever
      come near her, I will not fail to call and see her. Mary joins in sending
      love to your Fanny and you.

      After the "race," still smarting from the mortification of defeat, and the
      disappointment of a cherished hope, he took his old friend Jim Matheny
      away off to a solitary place in the woods, "and then and there," "with
      great emphasis," protested that he had not grown proud, and was not an
      aristocrat. "Jim," said he, in conclusion, "I am now, and always shall be,
      the same Abe Lincoln that I always was."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN 1844 Mr. Lincoln was again a candidate for elector on the Whig ticket.
      Mr. Clay, as he has said himself, was his "<i>beau-ideal</i> of a
      statesman," and he labored earnestly and as effectually as any one else
      for his election. For the most part, he still had his old antagonists to
      meet in the Springfield region, chief among whom this year was John
      Calhoun. With him and others he had joint debates, running through several
      nights, which excited much popular feeling. One of his old friends and
      neighbors, who attended all these discussions, speaks in very enthusiastic
      terms of Mr. Calhoun, and, after enumerating his many noble gifts of head
      and heart, concludes that "Calhoun came nearer of whipping Lincoln in
      debate than Douglas did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln made many speeches in Illinois, and finally, towards the close
      of the campaign, he went over into Indiana, and there continued "on the
      stump" until the end. Among other places he spoke at Rockport on the Ohio,&mdash;where
      he had first embarked for New Orleans with Gentry,&mdash;at Gentryville,
      and at a place in the country about two miles from the cabin where his
      father had lived. While he was in the midst of his speech at Gentryville,
      his old friend, Nat Grigsby, entered the room. Lincoln recognized him on
      the instant, and, stopping short in his remarks, cried out, "There's Nat!"
      Without the slightest regard for the proprieties of the occasion, he
      suspended his address totally, and, striding from the platform, began
      scrambling through the audience and over the benches, toward the modest
      Nat, who stood near the door. When he reached him, Lincoln shook his hand
      "cordially;" and, after felicitating himself sufficiently upon the happy
      meeting, he returned to the platform, and finished his speech. When that
      was over, Lincoln could not make up his mind to part with Nat, but
      insisted that they must sleep together. Accordingly, they wended their way
      to Col. Jones's, where that fine old Jackson Democrat received his
      distinguished "clerk" with all the honors he could show him. Nat says,
      that in the night a cat "began mewing, scratching, and making a fuss
      generally." Lincoln got up, took the cat in his hands, and stroking its
      back "gently and kindly," made it sparkle for Nat's amusement. He then
      "gently" put it out of the door, and, returning to bed, "commenced telling
      stories and talking over old times."

      It is hardly necessary to say, that the result of the canvass was a severe
      disappointment to Mr. Lincoln. No defeat but his own could have given him
      more pain; and thereafter he seems to have attended quietly to his own
      private business until the Congressional canvass of 1846.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thought for many years by some persons well informed, that between
      Lincoln, Logan, Baker, and Hardin,&mdash;four very conspicuous Whig
      leaders,&mdash;there was a secret personal understanding that they four
      should "rotate" in Congress until each had had a term. Baker succeeded
      Hardin in 1844; Lincoln was elected in 1846, and Logan was nominated, but
      defeated, in 1848. Lincoln publicly declined to contest the nomination
      with Baker in 1844; Hardin did the same for Lincoln in 1846 (although both
      seem to have acted reluctantly), and Lincoln refused to run against Logan
      in 1848. Col. Matheny and others insist, with great show of reason, that
      the agreement actually existed; and, if such was the case, it was
      practically carried out, although Lincoln was a candidate against Baker,
      and Hardin against Lincoln, as long as either of them thought there was
      the smallest prospect of success. They might have done this, however,
      merely to keep other and less tractable candidates out of the field. That
      Lincoln would cheerfully have made such a bargain to insure himself a seat
      in Congress, there can be no doubt; but the supposition that he did do it
      can scarcely be reconciled with the feeling displayed by him in the
      conflict with Baker, or the persistency of Hardin, to a very late hour, in
      the contest of 1846.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, Mr. Lincoln and Gen. Hardin were the two, and the only two,
      candidates for the Whig nomination in 1846. The contest was much like the
      one with Baker, and Lincoln was assailed in much the same fashion. He was
      called a deist and an infidel, both before and after his nomination, and
      encountered in a less degree the same opposition from the members of
      certain religious bodies that had met him before. But with Hardin he
      maintained personal relations the most friendly. The latter proposed to
      alter the mode of making the nomination; and, in the letter conveying this
      desire to Mr. Lincoln, he also offered to stipulate that each candidate
      should remain within the limits of his own county. To this Mr. Lincoln
      replied, "As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall
      remain in their own counties, and restrain their friends to the same, it
      seems to me, that, on reflection, you will see the fact of your having
      been in Congress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district
      as to give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation. I appreciate
      your desire to keep down excitement, and I promise you to 'keep cool'
      under the circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th of February, 1846, "The Journal" contained Gen. Hardin's card
      declining to be "longer considered a candidate," and in its editorial
      comments occurred the following: "We have had, and now have, no doubt that
      he (Hardin) has been, and now is, a great favorite with the Whigs of the
      district. He states, in substance, that there was never any understanding
      on his part that his name was not to be presented in the canvasses of 1844
      and 1846. This, we believe, is strictly true. Still, the doings of the
      Pekin Convention did seem to point that way; and the general's voluntary
      declination as to the canvass of 1844 was by many construed into an
      acquiescence on his part. These things had led many of his most devoted
      friends to not expect him to be a candidate at this time. Add to this the
      relation that Mr. Lincoln bears, and has borne, to the party, and it is
      not strange that many of those who are as strongly devoted to Gen. Hardin
      as they are to Mr. Lincoln should prefer the latter at this time. We do
      not entertain a doubt, that, if we could reverse the positions of the two
      men, that a very large portion of those who now have supported Mr. Lincoln
      most warmly would have supported Gen. Hardin quite as warmly." This
      article was admirably calculated to soothe Gen. Hardin, and to win over
      his friends. It was wise and timely. The editor was Mr. Lincoln's intimate
      friend. It is marked by Mr. Lincoln's style, and has at least one
      expression which was peculiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its issue of May 7, "The Journal" announced the nomination as having
      been made at Petersburg, on the Friday previous, and said further, "This
      nomination was, of course, anticipated, there being no other candidate in
      the field. Mr. Lincoln, we all know, is a good Whig, a good man, an able
      speaker, and richly deserves, as he enjoys, the confidence of the Whigs of
      this district and of the State."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Cartwright, the celebrated pioneer Methodist preacher, noted for his
      piety and combativeness, was Mr. Lincoln's competitor before the people.
      We know already the nature of the principal charges against Mr. Lincoln's
      personal character; and these, with the usual criticism upon Whig policy,
      formed the staple topics of the campaign on the Democratic side. But Peter
      himself did not escape with that impunity which might have been expected
      in the case of a minister of the gospel. Rough tongues circulated
      exaggerated stories of his wicked pugnacity and his worldly-mindedness,
      whilst the pretended servant of the Prince of peace. Many Democrats looked
      with intense disgust upon his present candidacy, and believed, that, by
      mingling in politics, he was degrading his office and polluting the
      Church. One of these Democrats told Mr. Lincoln what he thought, and said,
      that, although it was a hard thing to vote against his party, he would do
      it if it should be necessary to defeat Cartwright. Mr. Lincoln told him,
      that on the day of the election he would give him a candid opinion as to
      whether the vote was needed or not Accordingly, on that day, he called
      upon the gentleman, and said, "I have got the preacher,... and don't want
      your vote."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clay's majority in this district in 1844 had been but nine hundred and
      fourteen; whereas it now gave Mr. Lincoln a majority of fifteen hundred
      and eleven, in a year which had no Presidential excitements to bring out
      electors. In 1848 Gen. Taylor's majority was smaller by ten, and the same
      year the Whig candidate for Congress was defeated by a hundred and six.

      In the following letter to Mr. Speed, he intimates that the first
      sensations of pleasure attending his new distinction were not of long
      duration; at least, that there were moments in which, if he did not forget
      his greatness, it afforded him little joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Oct. 22, 1846.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You no doubt assign the suspension of our correspondence to the true
      philosophic cause; though it must be confessed by both of us, that this is
      rather a cold reason for allowing a friendship such as ours to die out by
      degrees. I propose now, that, upon receipt of this, you shall be
      considered in my debt, and under obligations to pay soon, and that neither
      shall remain long in arrears hereafter. Are you agreed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Being elected to Congress, though I am very grateful to our friends for
      having done it, has not pleased me as much as I expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a child
      as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is "short and low,"
      and expect always will be. He talks very plainly,&mdash;almost as plainly
      as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear he is one of the
      little rare-ripe sort, that are smarter at about five than ever after. He
      has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of much
      animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob
      was lost; but by the time I reached the house his mother had found him,
      and had him whipped; and by now, very likely, he is run away again. Mary
      has read your letter, and wishes to be remembered to Mrs. S. and you, in
      which I most sincerely join her. As ever yours.

      At the meeting of the Thirtieth Congress Mr. Lincoln took his seat, and
      went about the business of his office with a strong determination to do
      something memorable. He was the only Whig member from Illinois, and would
      be carefully watched. His colleagues were several of them old
      acquaintances of the Vandalia times. They were John McClernand, O. B.
      Ficklin, William A. Richardson, Thomas J. Turner, Robert Smith, and John
      Wentworth (Long John). And at this session that alert, tireless, ambitious
      little man, Stephen A. Douglas, took his seat in the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roll of this House shone with an array of great and brilliant names.
      Robert C. Winthrop was the Speaker. On the Whig side were John Quincy
      Adams, Horace Mann, Hunt of New York, Collamer of Vermont, Ingersoll of
      Pennsylvania, Botts and Goggin of Virginia, Morehead of Kentucky, Caleb B.
      Smith of Indiana, Stephens and Toombs of Georgia, Gentry of Tennessee, and
      Vinton and Schenck of Ohio. On the Democratic side were Wilmot of
      Pennsylvania, McLane of Maryland, McDowell of Virginia, Rhett of South
      Carolina, Cobb of Georgia, Boyd of Kentucky, Brown and Thompson of
      Mississippi, and Andrew Johnson and George W. Jones of Tennessee. In the
      Senate were Webster, Calhoun, Benton, Berrien, Clayton, Bell, Hunter, and
      William R. King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House organized on the 6th; and the day previous to that. Mr. Lincoln
      wrote to his friend and partner, William H. Herndon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Dec. 5, 1847.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;You may remember that about a year ago a man by the
      name of Wilson (James Wilson, I think) paid us twenty dollars as an
      advance fee to attend to a case in the Supreme Court for him, against a
      Mr. Campbell, the record of which case was in the hands of Mr. Dixon of
      St. Louis, who never furnished it to us. When I was at Bloomington last
      fall, I met a friend of Wilson, who mentioned the subject to me, and
      induced me to write to Wilson, telling him that I would leave the ten
      dollars with you which had been left with me to pay for making abstracts
      in the case, so that the case may go on this winter; but I came away, and
      forgot to do it. What I want now is to send you the money to be used
      accordingly, if any one comes on to start the case, or to be retained by
      you if no one does.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing of consequence new here. Congress is to organize
      to-morrow. Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated
      Winthrop of Massachusetts for Speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for
      Sergeant-at-arms, Homer of New Jersey Doorkeeper, and McCormick of
      District of Columbia Postmaster. The Whig majority in the House is so
      small, that, together with some little dissatisfaction, leaves it doubtful
      whether we will elect them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send only a
      halfsheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again on the 13th, to the same gentleman:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Dec. 13, 1847.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your letter advising me of the receipt of our fee in
      the bank-case is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good
      a piece of news from Springfield while I am away. I am under no
      obligations to the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank
      certificates, and pay my debt there, so as to pay it with the least money
      possible. I would as soon you should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other
      person at the bank, as of any one else, provided you can get them as
      cheaply. I suppose, after the bank-debt shall be paid, there will be some
      money left, out of which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout
      twenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for
      materials got for house-painting. If there shall still be any left, keep
      it till you see or hear from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get them. I wrote you
      yesterday about a "Congressional Globe." As you are all so anxious for me
      to distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was a member of the Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads,
      and in that capacity had occasion to study the claim of a mail-contractor
      who had appealed to Congress against a decision of the Department. Mr.
      Lincoln made a speech on the case, in which, being his first, he evidently
      felt some pride, and reported progress to his friends at home:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Jan. 8, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your letter of Dec. 27 was received a day or two ago.
      I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and promise to
      take, in my little business there. As to speech-making, by way of getting
      the hang of the House, I made a little speech two or three days ago, on a
      post-office question of no general interest. I find speaking <i>here and
      elsewhere</i> about the same thing. I was about as badly scared, and no
      worse, as I am when I speak in court. I expect to make one within a week
      or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very pleasant to me to learn from you that there are some who desire
      that I should be re-elected. I most heartily thank them for the kind
      partiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,
      that "<i>personally</i> I would not object" to a re-election, although I
      thought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me to
      return to the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration,
      that I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly
      with others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district
      from going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that,
      if it should so happen <i>that nobody else wishes to be elected</i>, I
      could not refuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter
      myself as a competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me,
      is what my word and honor forbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst
      our friends as to lose us the district; but I remember such letters were
      written to Baker when my own case was under consideration, and I trust
      there is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember I am always glad to receive a letter from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most truly your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly hostile to Polk, and hotly opposed to the war, Mr. Lincoln took
      an active, although not a leading part in the discussions relating to the
      commencement and conduct of the latter. He was politician enough, however,
      to go with the majority of his party in voting supplies to the troops, and
      thanks to the generals, whilst censuring the President by solemnly
      declaring that the "war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by
      the President of the United States." But his position, and the position of
      the Whigs, will be made sufficiently apparent by the productions of his
      own pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 22d of December, 1847, Mr. Lincoln introduced a preamble and
      resolutions, which attained great celebrity in Illinois under the title of
      "Spot Resolutions," and in all probability lost the party a great many
      votes in the Springfield district. They were as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, The President of the United States, in his Message of May 11,
      1846, has declared that "the Mexican Government not only refused to
      receive him [the envoy of the United States], or listen to his
      propositions, but, after a long-continued series of menaces, has at last
      invaded <i>our territory</i>, and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on
      <i>our own soil</i>;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And again, in his Message of Dec. 8, 1846, that "we had ample cause of war
      against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities; but even then
      we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself became
      the aggressor, by invading <i>our soil</i> in hostile array, and shedding
      the blood of our citizens;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet again, in his Message of Dec. 7, 1847, that "the Mexican
      Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he [our
      minister of peace] was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly
      unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by invading the
      territory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the
      blood of our citizens on <i>our own soil</i>;" and,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the
      facts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood
      of our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time "<i>our own soil</i>;"
      therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the President of the United
      States be respectfully requested to inform this House,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1st. Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in
      his Messages declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at
      least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      2d. Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested
      from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d. Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people, which
      settlement has existed ever since long before the Texas revolution, and
      until its inhabitants fled before the approach of the United States army.
    </p>
    <p>
      4th. Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all other
      settlements by the Gulf and the Rio Grande on the south and west, and by
      wide, uninhabited regions on the north and east.
    </p>
    <p>
      5th. Whether the people of that settlement, or a majority of them, or any
      of them, have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws of Texas
      or of the United States, by consent or by compulsion, either by accepting
      office, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or serving on juries, or
      having process served upon them, or in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      6th. Whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the
      approach of the United States army, leaving unprotected their homes and
      their growing crops, <i>before</i> the blood was shed, as in the Messages
      stated; and whether the first blood, so shed, was or was not shed within
      the enclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7th. Whether our <i>citizens</i>, whose blood was shed, as in his Messages
      declared, were or were not at that time armed officers and soldiers, sent
      into that settlement by the military order of the President, through the
      Secretary of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      8th. Whether the military force of the United States was or was not so
      sent into that settlement after Gen. Taylor had more than once intimated
      to the War Department, that, in his opinion, no such movement was
      necessary to the defence or protection of Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln improved the first favorable opportunity (Jan. 12, 1818), to
      address the House in the spirit of the "Spot Resolutions."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Committee of the Whole House, Jan. 12, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln addressed the Committee as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chairman,&mdash;Some, if not at all, of the gentlemen on the other
      side of the House, who have addressed the Committee within the last two
      days, have spoken rather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them,
      of the vote given a week or ten days ago, declaring that the war with
      Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the
      President. I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party
      wantonness, and that the one given is justly censurable, if it have no
      other or better foundation. I am one of those who joined in that vote, and
      did so under my best impression of the <i>truth</i> of the case. How I got
      this impression, and how it may possibly be removed, I will now try to
      show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who, because of
      knowing too <i>little</i>, or because of knowing too <i>much</i>, could
      not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President (in the beginning
      of it), should, nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent
      on that point, at least till the war should be ended. Some leading
      Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as
      I understand them; and I adhered to it, and acted upon it, until since I
      took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it, were it not
      that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides the
      continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for
      supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct;
      besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late Message, in which he
      tells us that Congress, with great unanimity (only two in the Senate and
      fourteen in the House dissenting), had declared that "by the act of the
      Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that government and the
      United States;" when the same journals that informed him of this also
      informed him, that, when that declaration stood disconnected from the
      question of supplies, sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely,
      voted against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the <i>truth</i>
      what he could not prove by telling the <i>whole truth</i>, demanding of
      all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to
      speak out; besides all this, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson], at a
      very early day in the session, brought in a set of resolutions expressly
      indorsing the original justice of the war on the part of the President.
      Upon these resolutions, when they shall be put on their passage, I shall
      be <i>compelled</i> to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing
      this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when
      it should come. I carefully examined the President's Messages, to
      ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The result
      of this examination was to make the impression, that, taking for true all
      the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his
      justification; and that the President would have gone further with his
      proof, if it had not been for the small matter that the <i>truth</i> would
      not permit him. Under the impression thus made, I gave the vote before
      mentioned. I propose now to give concisely the process of the examination
      I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President, in his first Message of May, 1846, declares that the soil
      was <i>ours</i> on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico; and he
      repeats that declaration, almost in the same language, in each successive
      annual Message,&mdash;thus showing that he esteems that point a highly
      essential one. In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the
      President. To my judgment, it is the <i>very point</i> upon which he
      should be justified or condemned. In his Message of December, 1846, it
      seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title, ownership
      to soil, or any thing else, is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion
      following one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to
      present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the
      first blood of the war was shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve, in the Message last
      referred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing
      testimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page
      fourteen. Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this, issue and
      evidence, is, from beginning to end, the sheerest deception. The issue, as
      he presents it, is in these words: "But there are those who, conceding all
      this to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas
      is the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching
      our army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texan line,
      and invaded the Territory of Mexico." Now, this issue is made up of two
      affirmatives, and no negative. The main deception of it is, that it
      assumes as true, that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary,
      and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly
      the boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A
      further deception is, that it will let in evidence which a true issue
      would exclude. A true issue made by the President would be about as
      follows: "I say the soil <i>was ours</i> on which the first blood was
      shed; there are those who say it was not."
    </p>
    <p>
      I now proceed to examine the President's evidence, as applicable to such
      an issue. When that evidence is analyzed, it is all included in the
      following propositions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. That the Rio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana, as we
      purchased it of France in 1803.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio Grande as her western
      boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That, by various acts, she had claimed it on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. That Santa Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognized the Rio Grande as
      her boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. That Texas <i>before</i>, and the United States <i>after</i>
      annexation, had <i>exercised</i> jurisdiction <i>beyond</i> the Nueces, <i>between</i>
      the two rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. That our Congress <i>understood</i> the boundary of Texas to extend
      beyond the Nueces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for each of these in its turn:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His first item is, that the Rio Grande was the western boundary of
      Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in 1803; and, seeming to expect
      this to be disputed, he argues over the amount of nearly a page to prove
      it true; at the end of which, he lets us know, that, by the treaty of
      1819, we sold to Spain the whole country, from the Rio Grande eastward to
      the Sabine. Now, admitting for the present, that the Rio Grande was the
      boundary of Louisiana, what, under Heaven, had that to do with the present
      boundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman, the line that once
      divided your land from mine can still be the boundary between us after I
      have sold my land to you, is, to me, beyond all comprehension. And how any
      man, with an honest purpose only of proving the truth, could ever have
      thought of introducing such a fact to prove such an issue, is equally
      incomprehensible. The outrage upon common right, of seizing as our own
      what we have once sold, merely because it was ours before we sold it, is
      only equalled by the outrage on common sense of any attempt to justify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President's next piece of evidence is, that "The Republic of Texas
      always <i>claimed</i> this river (Rio Grande) as her western boundary."
      That is not true, in fact. Texas <i>has</i> claimed it, but she has not <i>always</i>
      claimed it. There is, at least, one distinguished exception. Her State
      Constitution&mdash;the public's most solemn and well-considered act, that
      which may, without impropriety, be called her last will and testament,
      revoking all others&mdash;makes no such claim. But suppose she had always
      claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary? So that there is
      but claim against claim, leaving nothing proved until we get back of the
      claims, and find which has the better <i>foundation.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not in the order in which the President presents his evidence, I
      now consider that class of his statements which are, in substance, nothing
      more than that Texas has, by various acts of her Convention and Congress,
      claimed the Rio Grande as her boundary&mdash;<i>on paper</i>. I mean here
      what he says about the fixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in her old
      constitution (not her State Constitution), about forming congressional
      districts, counties, &amp;c. Now, all this is but naked <i>claim</i>; and
      what I have already said about claims is strictly applicable to this. If I
      should claim your land by word of mouth, that certainly would not make it
      mine; and if I were to claim it by a deed which I had made myself, and
      with which you had nothing to do, the claim would be quite the same in
      substance, or rather in utter nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I next consider the President's statement that Santa Anna, in his <i>treaty</i>
      with Texas, recognized the Rio Grande as the western boundary of Texas.
      Besides the position so often taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of
      war, a captive, <i>could not</i> bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem
      conclusive,&mdash;besides this, I wish to say something in relation to
      this treaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna. If any man would
      like to be amused by a sight at that <i>little</i> thing, which the
      President calls by that <i>big</i> name, he can have it by turning to
      "Niles's Register," vol. 1. p. 336. And if any one should suppose that
      "Niles's Register" is a curious repository of so mighty a document as a
      solemn treaty between nations, I can only say that I learned, to a
      tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the State Department, that
      the President himself never saw it anywhere else. By the way, I believe I
      should not err if I were to declare, that, during the first ten years of
      the existence of that document, it was never by anybody <i>called</i> a
      treaty; that it was never so called till the President, in his extremity,
      attempted, by so calling it, to wring something from it in justification
      of himself in connection with the Mexican war. It has none of the
      distinguishing features of a treaty. It does not call itself a treaty.
      Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico: he assumes only to act
      as president, commander-in-chief of the Mexican army and navy; stipulates
      that the then present hostilities should cease, and that he would not
      himself take up arms, nor influence the Mexican people to take up arms,
      against Texas during the existence of the war of independence. He did not
      recognize the independence of Texas; he did not assume to put an end to
      the war, but clearly indicated his expectation of its continuance; he did
      not say one word about boundary, and most probably never thought of it. It
      is stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the
      Territory of Texas, <i>passing to the other side of the Rio Grande;</i>
      and in another article it is stipulated, that, to prevent collisions
      between the armies, the Texan army should not approach nearer than within
      five leagues,&mdash;of what is not said; but clearly, from the object
      stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty recognizing the
      Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the singular feature of
      stipulating that Texas shall not go within five leagues of <i>her own</i>
      boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States
      afterwards, exercising jurisdiction beyond the Nueces, and between the two
      rivers. This actual exercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality
      of evidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does it go far
      enough? He tells us it went beyond the Nueces; but he does not tell us it
      went to the Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction was exercised between the
      two rivers; but he does not tell us it was exercised over all the
      territory between them. Some simple-minded people think it possible to
      cross one river and go beyond it, without going all the way to the next;
      that jurisdiction may be exercised between two rivers without covering all
      the country between them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who
      exercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the Wabash and the
      Mississippi; and yet so far is this from being all there is between those
      rivers, that it is just a hundred and fifty-two feet long by fifty wide,
      and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a neighbor
      between him and the Mississippi,&mdash;that is, just across the street, in
      that direction,&mdash;whom, I am sure, he could neither persuade nor force
      to give up his habitation; but which, nevertheless, he could certainly
      annex, if it were to be done by merely standing on his own side of the
      street and claiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next, the President tells us, the Congress of the United States
      understood the State of Texas they admitted into the Union to extend
      beyond the Nueces. Well, I suppose they did,&mdash;I certainly so
      understand it,&mdash;but how far beyond? That Congress did not understand
      it to extend clear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of
      their joint resolutions for admission, expressly leaving all questions of
      boundary to future adjustment. And it may be added, that Texas herself is
      proved to have had the same understanding of it that our Congress had, by
      the fact of the exact conformity of her new Constitution to those
      resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now through the whole of the President's evidence; and it is a
      singular fact, that, if any one should declare the President sent the army
      into the midst of a settlement of Mexican people, who had never submitted,
      by consent or by force, to the authority of Texas or of the United States,
      and that there, and thereby, the first blood of the war was shed, there is
      not one word in all the President has said which would either admit or
      deny the declaration. In this strange omission chiefly consists the
      deception of the President's evidence,&mdash;an omission which, it does
      seem to me, could scarcely have occurred but by design. My way of living
      leads me to be about the courts of justice; and there I have sometimes
      seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client's neck in a desperate case,
      employing every artifice to work round, befog, and cover up with many
      words, some position pressed upon him by the prosecution, which he dared
      not admit, and yet could not deny. Party bias may help to make it appear
      so; but, with all the allowance I can make for such bias, it still does
      appear to me that just such, and from just such necessity, are the
      President's struggles in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after my colleague (Mr. Richardson) introduced the resolutions I
      have mentioned, I introduced a preamble, resolution, and interrogatories,
      intended to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto
      untrodden ground. To show their relevancy, I propose to state my
      understanding of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between Texas
      and Mexico. It is, that, <i>wherever</i> Texas was <i>exercising</i>
      jurisdiction was hers; and wherever Mexico was exercising jurisdiction was
      hers; and that whatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of
      the one from that of the other was the true boundary between them. If, as
      is probably true, Texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank
      of the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the
      Rio Grande, then neither river was the boundary, but the uninhabited
      country between the two was. The extent of our territory in that region
      depended, not on any treaty-fixed boundary (for no treaty had attempted
      it), but on revolution. Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the
      power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government,
      and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most
      sacred right,&mdash;a right which, we hope and believe, is to liberate the
      world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an
      existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people
      that can may revolutionize, and make their own of so much of the territory
      as they inhabit. More than this, a <i>majority</i> of any portion of such
      people may revolutionize, putting down a <i>minority</i>, intermingled
      with or near about them, who may oppose their movements. Such minority was
      precisely the case of the Tories of our own Revolution. It is a quality of
      revolutions not to go by old lines or old laws, but to break up both, and
      make new ones. As to the country now in question, we bought it of France
      in 1803, and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President's
      statement. After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against
      Spain; and, still later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico. In my view,
      just so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining the <i>actual,</i>
      willing or unwilling, submission of the people, <i>so far</i> the country
      was hers, and no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as to
      whether Texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where the
      hostilities of the present war commenced, let the President answer the
      interrogatories I proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar
      ones. Let him answer fully, fairly, and candidly. Let him answer with <i>facts</i>,
      and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits where Washington sat;
      and, so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer. As a
      nation should not, and the Almighty will not, be evaded, so let him
      attempt no evasion, no equivocation. And if, so answering, he can show
      that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed; that it
      was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the
      inhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas, or
      of the United States, and that the same is true of the site of Fort Brown,
      then I am with him for his justification. In that case, I shall be most
      happy to reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive
      for desiring that the President may do this: I expect to give some votes,
      in connection with the war, which, without his so doing, will be of
      doubtful propriety, in my own judgment, but which will be free from the
      doubt if he does so. But if he cannot or will not do this,&mdash;if, on
      any pretence, or no pretence, he shall refuse or omit it,&mdash;then I
      shall be fully convinced of what I more than suspect already,&mdash;that
      he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of
      this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to Heaven against him; that he
      ordered Gen. Taylor into the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement,
      purposely to bring on a war; that, originally having some strong motive&mdash;what
      I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning&mdash;to involve the two
      countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the public
      gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory,&mdash;that
      attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that serpent's eye that
      charms to destroy,&mdash;he plunged into it, and has swept on and on,
      till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might
      be subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where. How like the
      half-insane mumbling of a fever-dream is the whole war part of the late
      Message! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we
      can get but territory; at another, showing us how we can support the war
      by levying contributions on Mexico. At one time urging the national honor,
      the security of the future, the prevention of foreign interference, and
      even the good of Mexico herself, as among the objects of the war; at
      another, telling us that, "to reject indemnity by refusing to accept a
      cession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to
      wage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite
      object." So, then, the national honor, security of the future, and every
      thing but territorial indemnity, may be considered the no purposes and
      indefinite objects of the war! But having it now settled that territorial
      indemnity is the only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here,
      all that he was content to take a few months ago, and the whole province
      of Lower California to boot, and to still carry on the war,&mdash;to take
      all we are fighting for, and still fight on. Again, the President is
      resolved, under all circumstances, to have full territorial indemnity for
      the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the
      excess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole of
      the Mexican territory. So, again, he insists that the separate national
      existence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how this
      can be done after we shall have taken all her territory. Lest the
      questions I here suggest be considered speculative merely, let me be
      indulged a moment in trying to show they are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war has gone on some twenty months; for the expenses of which,
      together with an inconsiderable old score, the President now claims about
      one-half of the Mexican territory, and that by far the better half, so far
      as concerns our ability to make any thing out of it. It is comparatively
      uninhabited; so that we could establish land-offices in it, and raise some
      money in that way. But the other half is already inhabited, as I
      understand it, tolerably densely for the nature of the country; and all
      its lands, or all that are valuable, already appropriated as private
      property. How, then, are we to make any thing out of these lands with this
      encumbrance on them, or how remove the encumbrance? I suppose no one will
      say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves of them,
      or even confiscate their property? How, then, can we make much out of this
      part of the territory? If the prosecution of the war has, in expenses,
      already equalled the better half of the country, how long its future
      prosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not a
      speculative but a practical question, pressing closely upon us; and yet it
      is a question which the President seems never to have thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the mode of terminating the war and securing peace, the President is
      equally wandering and indefinite. First, it is to be done by a more
      vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy's country;
      and, after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President
      drops down into a half-despairing tone, and tells us, that "with a people
      distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject to
      constant changes, by successive revolutions, <i>the continued success of
      our arms may fail to obtain a satisfactory peace."</i> Then he suggests
      the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels of
      their own leaders, and, trusting in our protection, to set up a government
      from which we can secure a satisfactory peace, telling us that, "<i>this
      may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace</i>." But soon he falls
      into doubt of this, too, and then drops back on to the already
      half-abandoned ground of "more vigorous prosecution." All this shows that
      the President is in no wise satisfied with his own positions. First, he
      takes up one, and, in attempting to argue us into it, he argues himself
      out of it; then seizes another, and goes through the same process; and
      then, confused at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the
      old one again, which he has some time before cast off. His mind, tasked
      beyond its power, is running hither and thither, like some tortured
      creature on a burning surface, finding no position on which it can settle
      down and be at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it is a singular omission in this Message, that it nowhere
      intimates <i>when</i> the President expects the war to terminate. At its
      beginning, Gen. Scott was, by this same President, driven into disfavor,
      if not disgrace, for intimating that peace could not be conquered in less
      than three or four months. But now at the end of about twenty months,
      during which time our arms have given us the most splendid successes,&mdash;every
      department, and every part, land and water, officers and privates,
      regulars and volunteers, doing all that men could do, and hundreds of
      things which it had ever before been thought that men could not do,&mdash;after
      all this, this same President gives us a long Message without showing us
      that, <i>as to the end,</i> he has himself even an imaginary conception.
      As I have before said, he knows not where he is. He is a bewildered,
      confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant he may be able to show
      that there is not something about his conscience more painful than all his
      mental perplexity.

      This speech he hastened to send home as soon as it was printed; for, while
      throughout he trod on unquestionable Whig ground, he had excellent reasons
      to fear the result. The following is the first letter to Mr. Herndon after
      the delivery of the speech, and notifying him of the fact:&mdash;

    <p>
      Washington, Jan. 19, 1848.

    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Enclosed you find a letter of Louis W. Candler. What
      is wanted is, that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note
      described has received any dividend in the Probate Court of Christian
      County, where the estate of Mr. Overton Williams has been administered on.
      If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note and send it to me, so that
      Candler can see the indorser of it. At all events, write me all about it,
      till I can somehow get it off hands. I have already been bored more than
      enough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his cursed,
      unreadable, and ungodly handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by next mail.

    <p>
      About the last of January, or the first of February, he began to hear the
      first murmurs of alarm and dissatisfaction from his district. He was now
      on the defensive, and compelled to write long and tedious letters to
      pacify some of the Whigs. Of this character are two extremely interesting
      epistles to Mr. Herndon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Feb. 1, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your letter of the 19th ult. was received last night,
      and for which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish to talk
      to you about at once is, that, because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment,
      you fear that you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not because
      of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but
      because if you misunderstand, I fear other good friends may also. That
      vote affirms, that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally
      commenced by the President; and I will stake my life, that, if you had
      been in my place, you would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted
      what you felt and knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have
      gone out of the House,&mdash;skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had
      skulked one vote, you would have had to skulk many more before the end of
      the session. Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move,
      or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice
      of the war; so that no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled to
      speak; and your only alternative is to tell the <i>truth or tell a lie</i>.
      I cannot doubt which you would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of
      supplies. I have always intended, and still intend, to vote supplies;
      perhaps not in the precise form recommended by the President, but in a
      better form for all purposes, except Locofoco party purposes. It is in
      this particular you seem mistaken. The Locos are untiring in their efforts
      to make the impression that all who vote supplies, or take part in the
      war, do, of necessity, approve the President's conduct in the beginning of
      it; but the Whigs have, from the beginning, made and kept the distinction
      between the two. In the very first act nearly all the Whigs voted against
      the preamble declaring that war existed by the act of Mexico; and yet
      nearly all of them voted for the supplies. As to the Whig men who have
      participated in the war, so far as they have spoken to my hearing, they do
      not hesitate to denounce as unjust the President's conduct in the
      beginning of the war. They do not suppose that such denunciation is
      directed by undying hatred to them, as "The Register" would have it
      believed. There are two such Whigs on this floor (Col. Haskell and Major
      James). The former fought as a colonel by the side of Col. Baker, at Cerro
      Gordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem
      dissatisfied with. The latter, the history of whose capture with Cassius
      Clay you well know, had not arrived here when that vote was given; but, as
      I understand, he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an
      occasion shall present. Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is
      undoubtedly that way; and, whenever he shall speak out, he will say so.
      Col. Donaphin, too, the favorite Whig of Missouri, and who overrun all
      Northern Mexico, on his return home, in a public speech at St. Louis,
      condemned the administration in relation to the war, if I remember. G. T.
      M. Davis, who has been through almost the whole war, declares in favor of
      Mr. Clay; from which I infer that he adopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay,
      generally at least. On the other hand, I have heard of but one Whig who
      has been to the war attempting to justify the President's conduct. That
      one was Capt. Bishop; editor of "The Charleston Courier," and a very
      clever fellow. I do not mean this letter for the public, but for you.
      Before it reaches you, you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech,
      and, perhaps, scared anew by it. After you get over your scare, read it
      over again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly what you think of
      it. I condensed all I could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule;
      and, when I got through, I had spoken but forty-five minutes. Yours
      forever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Feb. 15, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your letter of the 29th January was received last
      night. Being exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some
      reflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates
      you. Let me first state what I understand to be your position. It is,
      that, if it shall become necessary <i>to repel invasion</i>, the President
      may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line, and <i>invade</i>
      the territory of another country; and that whether such <i>necessity</i>
      exists in any given case, the President is the <i>sole</i> judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going farther, consider well whether this is, or is not, your
      position. If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself,
      nor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken. Their only
      positions are, first, that the soil was ours where the hostilities
      commenced; and second, that, whether it was rightfully ours or not,
      Congress had annexed it, and the President, for that reason, was bound to
      defend it, both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you
      can prove that your house is mine. That soil was not ours; and Congress
      did not annex, or attempt to annex it. But to return to your position.
      Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem
      it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so <i>whenever
      he may choose to say</i> he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you
      allow him to make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix <i>any
      limit</i> to his power in this respect, after having given him so much as
      you propose. If to-day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to
      invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop
      him? You may say to him, "I see no probability of the British invading
      us;" but he will say to you, "Be silent: I see it, if you don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress
      was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: kings had
      always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending
      generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This
      our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly
      oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that <i>no one
      man</i> should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But
      your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings
      have always stood.
    </p>

      Write soon again.

    <p>
      But the Whig National Convention to nominate a candidate for the
      Presidency was to meet at Philadelphia on the 1st of June, and Mr. Lincoln
      was to be a member. He was not a Clay man: he wanted a candidate that
      could be elected; and he was for "Old Rough," as the only available
      material at hand. But let him explain himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, April 30, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Williams,&mdash;I have not seen in the papers any evidence of a
      movement to send a delegate from your circuit to the June Convention. I
      wish to say that I think it all important that a delegate should be sent.
      Mr. Clay's chance for an election is just no chance at all. He might get
      New York; and that would have elected in 1844, but it will not now,
      because he must now, at the least, lose Tennessee, which he had then, and
      in addition the fifteen new votes of Florida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin.
      I know our good friend Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I
      therefore fear he is favoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to discard
      feeling, and try if he can possibly, as a matter of judgment, count the
      votes necessary to elect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my judgment we can elect nobody but Gen. Taylor; and we cannot elect
      him without a nomination. Therefore don't fail to send a delegate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Archibald Williams, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, June 12, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Williams,&mdash;On my return from Philadelphia, where I had been
      attending the nomination of "Old Rough," I found your letter in a mass of
      others which had accumulated in my absence. By many, and often, it had
      been said they would not abide the nomination of Taylor; but, since the
      deed has been done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall
      have a most overwhelming, glorious triumph. One unmistakable sign is, that
      all the odds and ends are with us,&mdash;Barnburners, Native Americans,
      Tyler men, disappointed, office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows
      what. This is important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind
      blows. Some of the sanguine men here set down all the States as certain
      for Taylor but Illinois, and it is doubtful. Cannot something be done even
      in Illinois? Taylor's nomination takes the Locos on the blind side. It
      turns the war thunder against them. The war is now to them the gallows of
      Haman, which they built for us, and on which they are doomed to be hanged
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excuse this short letter. I have so many to write that I cannot devote
      much time to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his young partner in the law gave him a great deal of annoyance. Mr.
      Herndon seems to have been troubled by patriotic scruples. He could not
      understand how the war had been begun unconstitutionally and unnecessarily
      by President Polk, nor how the Whigs could vote supplies to carry on the
      war without indorsing the war itself. Besides all this, he sent news of
      startling defections; and the weary Representative took up his pen again
      and again to explain, defend, and advise:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, June 22,1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Last night I was attending a sort of caucus of the
      Whig members, held in relation to the coming Presidential election. The
      whole field of the nation was scanned; and all is high hope and
      confidence. Illinois is expected to better her condition in this race.
      Under these circumstances, judge how heart-rending it was to come to my
      room and find and read your discouraging letter of the 15th. We have made
      no gains, but have lost "H. R. Robinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or
      five more." Tell Arney to reconsider, if he would be saved. Baker and I
      used to do something, but I think you attach more importance to our
      absence than is just. There is another cause: in 1840, for instance, we
      had two Senators and five Representatives in Sangamon; now, we have part
      of one Senator and two Representatives. With quite one-third more people
      than we had then, we have only half the sort of offices which are sought
      by men of the speaking sort of talent. This, I think, is the chief cause.
      Now, as to the young men. You must not wait to be brought forward by the
      older men. For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into
      notice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men.
      You young men get together and form a Rough and Ready Club, and have
      regular meetings and speeches. Take in everybody that you can get.
      Harrison, Grimsley, Z. A. Enos, Lee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to
      begin the thing; but, as you go along, gather up all the shrewd, wild boys
      about town, whether just of age or a little under age,&mdash;Chris. Logan,
      Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such. Let every one play the
      part he can play best,&mdash;some speak, some sing, and all hollow (holler
      ED). Your meetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will
      go to hear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of
      "Old Zack," but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the
      intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't fail to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me to send you all the speeches made about "Old Zack," the war,
      &amp;c., &amp;c. Now, this makes me a little impatient. I have regularly
      sent you "The Congressional Globe" and "Appendix," and you cannot have
      examined them, or you would have discovered that they contain every speech
      made by every man in both Houses of Congress, on every subject, during the
      session. Can I send any more? Can I send speeches that nobody has made?
      Thinking it would be most natural that the newspapers would feel
      interested to give at least some of the speeches to their readers, I, at
      the beginning of the session, made arrangements to have one copy of "The
      Globe" and "Appendix" regularly sent to each Whig paper of the district.
      And yet, with the exception of my own little speech, which was published
      in two only of the then five, now four, Whig papers, I do not remember
      having seen a single speech, or even extract from one, in any single one
      of those papers. With equal and full means on both sides, I will venture
      that "The State Register" has thrown before its readers more of Locofoco
      speeches in a month than all the Whig papers of the district have done of
      Whig speeches during the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what I believe I
      said to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, is to
      be found in the speech of Dixon of Connecticut. This I sent you in
      pamphlet, as well, as in "The Globe." Examine and study every sentence of
      that speech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask how Congress came to declare that war had existed by the act of
      Mexico. Is it possible you don't understand that yet? You have at least
      twenty speeches in your possession that fully explain it. I will, however,
      try it once more. The news reached Washington of the commencement of
      hostilities on the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of Gen. Taylor's
      army. Everybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and
      money. It was necessary to pass a bill for this. The Locos had a majority
      in both Houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble, saying, <i>Whereas</i>,
      War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send Gen. Taylor money. The
      Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could vote to send
      the men and money, without saying any thing about how the war commenced;
      but, being in the minority, they were voted down, and the preamble was
      retained. Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came upon them,
      "Shall we vote for preamble and bill both together, or against both
      together?" They did not want to vote against sending help to Gen. Taylor,
      and therefore they voted for both together. Is there any difficulty in
      understanding this? Even my little speech shows how this was; and, if you
      will go to the library, you may get "The Journal" of 1845-46, in which you
      can find the whole for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have nothing published yet with special reference to the Taylor race;
      but we soon will have, and then I will send them to everybody. I made an
      internal-improvement speech day before yesterday, which I shall send home
      as soon as I can get it written out and printed,&mdash;and which I suppose
      nobody will read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend as ever,

    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, July 10, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your letter covering the newspaper slips was received
      last night. The subject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me; and I
      cannot but think there is some mistake in your impression of the motives
      of the old men. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare, on
      my veracity, which I think is good with you, that nothing could afford me
      more satisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at
      home were doing battle in the contest, and endearing themselves to the
      people, and taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach in
      their admiration. I cannot conceive that other old men feel differently.
      Of course, I cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was young once, and I am
      sure I was never ungenerously thrust back. I hardly know what to say. The
      way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never
      suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure you that
      suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation. There may
      sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and they will
      succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel,
      to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about, and see if this feeling
      has not injured every person you have ever known to fall into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in what I have said, I am sure you will suspect nothing but sincere
      friendship. I would save you from a fatal error. You have been a
      laborious, studious young man. You are far better informed on almost all
      subjects than I have ever been. You cannot fail in any laudable object,
      unless you allow your mind to be improperly directed. I have some the
      advantage of you in the world's experience, merely by being older; and it
      is this that induces me to advise.
    </p>
    <p>
      You still seem to be a little mistaken about "The Congressional Globe" and
      "Appendix." They contain <i>all</i> of the speeches that are published in
      any way. My speech and Dayton's speech, which you say you got in pamphlet
      form, are both, word for word, in the "Appendix." I repeat again, all are
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your friend, as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "internal-improvement" speech to which Mr. Lincoln alludes in one of
      these letters was delivered on the 20th of June, and contained nothing
      remarkable or especially characteristic. It was in the main merely the
      usual Whig argument in favor of the constitutionality of Mr. Clay's
      "American System."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after the nominations at Baltimore and Philadelphia, everybody in
      either House of Congress who could compose any thing at all "on his legs,"
      or in the closet, felt it incumbent upon him to contribute at least one
      electioneering speech to the political literature of the day. At last, on
      the 27th of July, Mr. Lincoln found an opportunity to make his. Few like
      it have ever been heard in either of those venerable chambers. It is a
      common remark of those who know nothing of the subject, that Mr. Lincoln
      was devoid of imagination; but the reader of this speech will entertain a
      different opinion. It opens to us a mind fertile in images sufficiently
      rare and striking, but of somewhat questionable taste. It must have been
      heard in amazement by those gentlemen of the House who had never known a
      Hanks, or seen a New Salem.
    </p>
    <p>
      SPEECH ON THE PRESIDENCY AND GENERAL POLITICS. DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE,
      JULY 27, 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker,&mdash;Our Democratic friends seem to be in great distress
      because they think our candidate for the Presidency don't suit us. Most of
      them cannot find out that Gen. Taylor has any principles at all; some,
      however, have discovered that he has one, but that that one is entirely
      wrong. This one principle is his position on the veto power. The gentleman
      from Tennessee (Mr. Stanton), who has just taken his seat, indeed, has
      said there is very little, if any, difference on this question between
      Gen. Taylor and all the Presidents; and he seems to think it sufficient
      detraction from Gen. Taylor's position on it, that it has nothing new in
      it. But all others whom I have heard speak assail it furiously. A new
      member from Kentucky (Mr. Clarke) of very considerable ability, was in
      particular concern about it. He thought it altogether novel and
      unprecedented for a President, or a Presidential candidate, to think of
      approving bills whose constitutionality may not be entirely clear to his
      own mind. He thinks the ark of our safety is gone, unless Presidents shall
      always veto such bills as, in their judgment, may be of doubtful
      constitutionality. However clear Congress may be of their authority to
      pass any particular act, the gentleman from Kentucky thinks the President
      must veto it if he has doubts about it. Now, I have neither time nor
      inclination to argue with the gentleman on the veto power as an original
      question; but I wish to show that Gen. Taylor, and not he, agrees with the
      earliest statesmen on this question. When the bill chartering the first
      Bank of the United States passed Congress, its constitutionality was
      questioned; Mr. Madison, then in the House of Representatives, as well as
      others, had opposed it on that ground. Gen. Washington, as President, was
      called on to approve or reject it. He sought and obtained, on the
      constitutional question, the separate written opinions of Jefferson,
      Hamilton, and Edmund Randolph; they then being respectively Secretary of
      State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Attorney-General. Hamilton's opinion
      was for the power; while Randolph's and Jefferson's were both against it.
      Mr. Jefferson, in his letter dated Feb. 15, 1791, after giving his opinion
      decidedly against the constitutionality of that bill, closed with the
      paragraph which I now read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be admitted, however, that, unless the President's mind, on a
      view of every thing which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably
      clear that it is unauthorized by the Constitution; if the pro and the con
      hang so even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for the wisdom of
      the Legislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of their
      opinion; it is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error,
      ambition, or interest, that the Constitution has placed a check in the
      negative of the President."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gen. Taylor's opinion, as expressed in his Allison letter, is as I now
      read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The power given by the veto is a high conservative power, but, in my
      opinion, should never be exercised, except in cases of clear violation of
      the Constitution, or manifest haste and want of consideration by
      Congress."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is here seen, that, in Mr. Jefferson's opinion, if, on the
      constitutionality of any given bill, the President doubts, he is not to
      veto it, as the gentleman from Kentucky would have him to do, but is to
      defer to Congress, and approve it. And if we compare the opinions of
      Jefferson and Taylor, as expressed in these paragraphs, we shall find them
      more exactly alike than we can often find any two expressions having any
      literal difference. None but interested fault-finders can discover any
      substantial variation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed that Gen. Taylor
      has no other principle. They are in utter darkness as to his opinions on
      any of the questions of policy which occupy the public attention. But is
      there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent question, if
      elected? Not the least. It is not possible to know what he will or would
      do in every imaginable case, because many questions have passed away, and
      others doubtless will arise, which none of us have yet thought of; but on
      the prominent questions of currency, tariff, internal improvements, and
      Wilmot Proviso, Gen. Taylor's course is at least as well defined as is
      Gen. Cass's. Why, in their eagerness to get at Gen. Taylor, several
      Democratic members here have desired to know whether, in case of his
      election, a bankrupt-law is to be established. Can they tell us Gen.
      Cass's opinion on this question? (Some member answered, He is against
      it.") Ay, how do you know he is? There is nothing about it in the
      platform, nor elsewhere, that I have seen. If the gentleman knows any
      thing which I do not, he can show it. But to return: Gen. Taylor, in his
      Allison letter, says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon the subject of the tariff, the currency, the improvement of our
      great highways, rivers, lakes, and harbors, the will of the people, as
      expressed through their Representatives in Congress, ought to be respected
      and carried out by the Executive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this is the whole matter: in substance, it is this: The people say to
      Gen. Taylor, "If you are elected, shall we have a national bank?" He
      answers, "Your will, gentlemen, not mine"&mdash;"What about the tariff?"&mdash;"Say
      yourselves."&mdash;"Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?"&mdash;"Just
      as you please."&mdash;"If you desire a bank, an alteration of the tariff,
      internal improvements, any or all, I will not hinder you: if you do not
      desire them, I will not attempt to force them on you. Send up your members
      of Congress from the various districts, with opinions according to your
      own, and if they are for these measures, or any of them, I shall have
      nothing to oppose: if they are not for them, I shall not, by any
      appliances whatever, attempt to dragoon them into their adoption." Now,
      can there be any difficulty in understanding this? To you, Democrats, it
      may not seem like principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the
      position plain enough. The distinction between it and the position of your
      candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show
      it is wrong, if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot see
      it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the best
      sort of principle at that,&mdash;the principle of allowing the people to
      do as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (Mr. C.
      B. Smith) has aptly asked, "Are you willing to trust the people?" Some of
      you answered substantially, "We are willing to trust the people; but the
      President is as much the representative of the people as Congress." In a
      certain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the
      people. He is elected by them as well as Congress is. But can he, in the
      nature of things, know the wants of the people as well as three hundred
      other men coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so,
      where is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives
      the President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative
      should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable
      him, and, in fact, almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation
      into his own hands, is what we object to, is what Gen. Taylor objects to,
      and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus
      transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with
      minuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not
      and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea,&mdash;that if a
      Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather
      upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect
      him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. This, though
      plausible, is a most pernicious deception. By means of it, measures are
      adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and
      often nearly half of the other. The process is this: Three, four, or half
      a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its
      candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all
      but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and
      his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large
      portion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole are
      strung together, and they must take all or reject all. They cannot take
      what they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed to
      being the majority, they shut their eyes and gulp the whole. Next
      election, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes
      along the line of the past, we shall see that almost, if not quite, all
      the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced
      upon the party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to
      internal improvements is to be established if Gen. Cass shall be elected.
      Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements, but they will vote
      for Cass; and, if he succeeds, their votes will have aided in closing the
      doors against improvements. Now, this is a process which we think is
      wrong. We prefer a candidate, who, like Gen. Taylor, will allow the people
      to have their own way, regardless of his private opinion; and I should
      think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a
      candidate. He would force nothing on them which they don't want; and he
      would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if
      elected, will not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker, I have said Gen. Taylor's position is as well defined as is
      that of Gen. Cass. In saying this, I admit I do not certainly know what he
      would do on the Wilmot Proviso. I am a Northern man, or, rather, a Western
      Free State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with personal
      feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery. As such, and with
      what information I have, I hope and <i>believe</i> Gen. Taylor, if
      elected, would not veto the proviso; but I do not <i>know</i> it. Yet, if
      I knew he would, I still would vote for him. I should do so, because, in
      my judgment, his election alone can defeat Gen. Cass; and because, <i>should</i>
      slavery thereby go into the territory we now have, just so much will
      certainly happen by the election of Cass, and, in addition, a course of
      policy leading to new wars, new acquisitions of territory, and still
      farther extensions of slavery. One of the two is to be President; which is
      preferable?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as there is of Taylor
      on the proviso. I have no doubt myself of Gen. Cass on this question, but
      I know the Democrats differ among themselves as to his position. My
      internal-improvement colleague (Mr. Wentworth) stated on this floor the
      other day, that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements, because he had
      voted for all the bills that he (Mr. W.) had. So far, so good. But Mr.
      Polk vetoed some of these very bills; the Baltimore Convention passed a
      set of resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes; and Cass
      declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that he has carefully
      read these resolutions, and that he adheres to them as firmly as he
      approves them cordially. In other words, Gen. Cass voted for the bills,
      and thinks the President did right to veto them; and his friends here are
      amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the other, just as
      one or the other may correspond with their own respective inclinations. My
      colleague admits that the platform declares against the constitutionality
      of a general system of improvement, and that Gen. Cass indorses the
      platform; but he still thinks Gen. Cass is in favor of some sort of
      improvements. Well, what are they? As he is against <i>general</i>
      objects, those he is for must be particular and local. Now, this is taking
      the subject precisely by the wrong end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Particularity</i>&mdash;expending the money of the <i>whole</i> people
      for an object which will benefit only a <i>portion</i> of them&mdash;is
      the greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so held by Gen.
      Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till now. But now, behold,
      the objects most general, nearest free from this objection, are to be
      rejected, while those most liable to it are to be embraced. To return: I
      cannot help believing that Gen. Cass, when he wrote his letter of
      acceptance, well understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both
      sides of this question, and that he then closed the door against all
      further expressions of opinion, purposely to retain the benefits of that
      double position. His subsequent equivocation at Cleveland, to my mind,
      proves such to have been the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more, and I shall have done with this branch of the subject. You
      Democrats and your candidate, in the main, are in favor of laying down in
      advance a platform,&mdash;a set of party positions, as a unit; and then of
      enforcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however
      unpalatable some of them may be. We and our candidate are in favor of
      making Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct
      matters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward
      legislate just as they please, without any hinderance, save only so much
      as may guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and
      want of consideration. The difference between us is clear as noonday. That
      we are right, we cannot doubt. We hold the true republican position. In
      leaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong. We are
      willing, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any
      principles. The most I can expect is, to assure you that we think we have,
      and are quite contented with them. The other day, one of the gentlemen
      from Georgia (Mr. Iverson), an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far
      as I can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly.
      He spoke in what "The Baltimore American" calls the "scathing and
      withering style." At the end of his second severe flash I was struck
      blind, and found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my
      continued physical existence. A little of the bone was left, and I
      gradually revived. He eulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and
      then declared that we had deserted all our principles, and had turned
      Henry Clay out, like an old horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It
      cannot be answered by argument; at least, I cannot so answer it. I merely
      wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of,
      who sometimes turn old horses out to root? Is not a certain Martin Van
      Buren an old horse which your own party have turned out to root? and is he
      not rooting a little to your discomfort about now? But, in not nominating
      Mr. Clay, we deserted our principles, you say. Ah! in what? Tell us, ye
      men of principles, what principle we violated? We say you did violate
      principle in discarding Van Buren, and we can tell you how. You violated
      the primary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all
      Democratic representative government,&mdash;the principle that the
      representative is bound to carry out the known will of his constituents. A
      large majority of the Baltimore Convention of 1844 were, by their
      constituents, instructed to procure Van Buren's nomination if they could.
      In violation, in utter, glaring contempt of this, you rejected him,&mdash;rejected
      him, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Birdsall), the other day
      expressly admitted, for <i>availability</i>,&mdash;that same "general
      availability" which you charge upon us, and daily chew over here, as
      something exceedingly odious and unprincipled. But the gentleman from
      Georgia (Mr. Iverson) gave us a second speech yesterday, all well
      considered and put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and
      withered a "few" for his present position and movements. I cannot remember
      the gentleman's precise language, but I do remember he put Van Buren down,
      down, till he got him where he was finally to "stink" and "rot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to defend Martin Van
      Buren. In the war of extermination now waging between him and his old
      admirers, I say, Devil take the hindmost&mdash;and the foremost. But there
      is no mistaking the origin of the breach; and, if the curse of "stinking"
      and "rotting" is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle
      in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest, that the gentleman from Georgia
      and his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have Gen. Cass in hand, I wish to say a word about his political
      principles. As a specimen, I take the record of his progress on the Wilmot
      Proviso. In "The Washington Union" of March 2, 1847, there is a report of
      the speech of Gen. Cass, made the day before in the Senate, on the Wilmot
      Proviso, during the delivery of which, Mr. Miller of New Jersey is
      reported to have interrupted him as follows, to wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Miller expressed his great surprise at the change in the sentiments
      of the Senator from Michigan, who had been regarded as the great champion
      of freedom in the North-west, of which he was a distinguished ornament.
      Last year the Senator from Michigan was understood to be decidedly in
      favor of the Wilmot Proviso; and, as no reason had been stated for the
      change, he (Mr. Miller) could not refrain from the expression of his
      extreme surprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, Gen. Cass is reported to have replied as follows, to wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Cass said, that the course of the Senator from New Jersey was most
      extraordinary. Last year he (Mr. Cass) should have voted for the
      proposition had it come up. But circumstances had altogether changed. The
      honorable Senator then read several passages from the remarks as given
      above which he had committed to writing, in order to refute such a charge
      as that of the Senator from New Jersey."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "remarks above committed to writing," is one numbered 4, as
      follows, to wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "4th. Legislation would now be wholly imperative, because no territory
      hereafter to be acquired can be governed without an act of Congress
      providing for its government. And such an act, on its passage, would open
      the whole subject, and leave the Congress called on to pass it free to
      exercise its own discretion, entirely uncontrolled by any declaration
      found in the statute-book."
    </p>
    <p>
      In "Niles's Register," vol. lxxiii., p. 293, there is a letter of Gen.
      Cas? to A. O. P. Nicholson of Nashville, Tenn., dated Dec. 24, 1847, from
      which the following are correct extracts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Wilmot Proviso has been before the country some time. It has been
      repeatedly discussed in Congress, and by the public press. I am strongly
      impressed with the opinion that a great change has been going on in the
      public mind upon this subject,&mdash;in my own as well as others; and that
      doubts are resolving themselves into convictions, that the principle it
      involves should be kept out of the national Legislature, and left to the
      people of the Confederacy in their respective local governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Briefly, then, I am opposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction by
      Congress over this matter; and I am in favor of leaving the people of any
      territory which may be hereafter acquired, the right to regulate it
      themselves, under the general principles of the Constitution. Because,
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. I do not see in the Constitution any grant of the requisite power to
      Congress; and I am not disposed to extend a doubtful precedent beyond its
      necessity,&mdash;the establishment of territorial governments when needed,&mdash;leaving
      to the inhabitants all the rights compatible with the relations they bear
      to the Confederation."
    </p>
    <p>
      These extracts show, that, in 1846, Gen. Cass was for the Proviso <i>at
      once</i>; that, in March, 1847, he was still for it, <i>but not just then</i>;
      and that in December, 1847, he was <i>against</i> it altogether. This is a
      true index to the whole man. When the question was raised in 1846, he was
      in a blustering hurry to take ground for it. He sought to be in advance,
      and to avoid the uninteresting position of a mere follower; but soon he
      began to see glimpses of the great Democratic ox-gad waving in his face,
      and to hear indistinctly a voice saying, "Back!" "Back, sir!" "Back a
      little!" He shakes his head, and bats his eyes, and blunders back to his
      position of March, 1847; but still the gad waves, and the voice grows more
      distinct, and sharper still,&mdash;"Back, sir!" "Back, I say!" "Further
      back!" and back he goes to the position of December, 1847; at which the
      gad is still, and the voice soothingly says, "So!" "Stand still at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Have no fears, gentlemen, of your candidate: he exactly suits you, and we
      congratulate you upon it. However much you may be distressed about our
      candidate, you have all cause to be contented and happy with your own. If
      elected, he may not maintain all, or even any, of his positions previously
      taken; but he will be sure to do whatever the party exigency, for the time
      being, may require; and that is precisely what you want. He and Van Buren
      are the same "manner of men;" and, like Van Buren, he will never desert
      you till you first desert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      [After referring at some length to extra "charges" of Gen. Cass upon the
      Treasury, Mr. Lincoln continued:&mdash;-]
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have introduced Gen. Cass's accounts here chiefly to show the
      wonderful physical capacities of the man. They show that he not only did
      the labor of several men at the same <i>time</i>, but that he often did
      it, at several <i>places</i> many hundred miles apart, <i>at the same time</i>.
      And at eating, too, his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful.
      From October, 1821, to May, 1822, he ate ten rations a day in Michigan,
      ten rations a day here in Washington, and nearly five dollars' worth a day
      besides, partly on the road between the two places. And then there is an
      important discovery in his example,&mdash;the art of being paid for what
      one eats, instead of having to pay for it. Hereafter, if any nice young
      man shall owe a bill which he cannot pay in any other way, he can just
      board it out. Mr. Speaker, we have all heard of the animal standing in
      doubt between two stacks of hay, and starving to death: the like of that
      would never happen to Gen. Cass. Place the stacks a thousand miles apart,
      he would stand stock-still, midway between them, and eat them both at
      once; and the green grass along the line would be apt to suffer some, too,
      at the same time. By all means make him President, gentlemen. He will feed
      you bounteously&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;there is any left after he shall
      have helped himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Gen. Taylor is, par excellence, the hero of the Mexican War, and as
      you Democrats say we Whigs have always opposed the war, you think it must
      be very awkward and embarrassing for us to go for Gen. Taylor. The
      declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or false
      accordingly as one may understand the term "opposing the war." If to say
      "the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the
      President," by opposing the war, then the Whigs have very generally
      opposed it. Whenever they have spoken at all, they have said this; and
      they have said it on what has appeared good reason to them: the marching
      an army into the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, frightening the
      inhabitants away, leaving their growing crops and other property to
      destruction, to you may appear a perfectly amiable, peaceful, unprovoking
      procedure; but it does not appear so to us. So to call such an act, to us
      appears no other than a naked, impudent absurdity, and we speak of it
      accordingly. But if when the war had begun, and had become the cause of
      the country, the giving of our money and our blood, in common with yours,
      was support of the war, then it is not true that we have always opposed
      the war. With few individual exceptions, you have constantly had our votes
      here for all the necessary supplies. And, more than this, you have had the
      services, the blood, and the lives of our political brethren in every
      trial, and on every field. The beardless boy and the mature man, the
      humble and the distinguished,&mdash;you have had them. Through suffering
      and death, by disease and in battle, they have endured and fought and
      fallen with you. Clay and Webster each gave a son, never to be returned.
      From the State of my own residence, besides other worthy but less known
      Whig names, we sent Marshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin: they all
      fought, and one fell, and in the fall of that one we lost our best Whig
      man. Nor were the Whigs few in number, or laggard in the day of danger. In
      that fearful, bloody, breathless struggle at Buena Vista, where each man's
      hard task was to beat back five foes or die himself, of the five high
      officers who perished, four were Whigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of this, I mean no odious comparison between the lion-hearted
      Whigs and Democrats who fought there. On other occasions, and among the
      lower officers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the proportion
      was different. I wish to do justice to all. I think of all those brave men
      as Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I, too, have a share.
      Many of them, Whigs and Democrats, are my constituents and personal
      friends; and I thank them,&mdash;more than thank them,&mdash;one and all,
      for the high, imperishable honor they have conferred on our common State.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the distinction between the <i>cause of the President in beginning the
      war,</i> and the <i>cause of the country after it was begun</i>, is a
      distinction which you cannot perceive. To you, the President and the
      country seem to be all one. You are interested to see no distinction
      between them; and I venture to suggest that possibly your interest blinds
      you a little. We see the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our
      friends, who have fought in the war, have no difficulty in seeing it also.
      What those who have fallen would say, were they alive and here, of course
      we can never know; but with those who have returned there is no
      difficulty. Col. Haskell and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in
      the war; and one of them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships;
      still they, like all other Whigs here, vote on the record that the war was
      unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President. And even
      Gen. Taylor himself, the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that, as
      a citizen, and particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to know
      that his country is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his power
      to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination, by the most vigorous
      and energetic operations, without inquiring about its justice, or any
      thing else connected with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with the assurance
      that we are content with our position, content with our company, and
      content with our candidate; and that although they, in their generous
      sympathy, think we ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they
      may dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account.1

      "But the gentleman from Georgia further says, we have deserted all our
      principles, and taken shelter under Gen. Taylor's military coat-tail; and
      he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading. Well, as his faith is, so
      be it unto him. But can he remember no other military coat-tail, under
      which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a
      century? Has he no acquaintance with the ample military coat-tail of Gen.
      Jackson? Does he not know that his own party have run the last five
      Presidential races under that coat-tail? and that they are now running the
      sixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used, not only
      for Gen, Jackson himself, but has been clung to with the grip of death by
      every Democratic candidate since. You have never ventured, and dare not
      now venture, from under it. Your campaign papers have constantly been 'Old
      Hickories,' with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory
      poles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems. Mr. Polk himself was
      'Young Hickory.' 'Little Hickory,' or something so; and even now your
      campaign paper here is proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the
      'Hickory stripe.' No, sir, you dare not give it up. Like a horde of hungry
      ticks, you have stuck to the tail of the Hermitage lion to the end of his
      life; and you are still sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance
      from it, after he is dead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a
      discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one, and have
      enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog. Just such a
      discovery has Gen. Jackson's popularity been to you. You not only twice
      made President of him out of it, but you have enough of the stuff left to
      make Presidents of several comparatively small men since; and it is your
      chief reliance now to make still another.

      "Mr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of any sort,
      are not figures of speech such as I would be the first to introduce into
      discussions here; but, as the gentleman from Georgia has thought fit to
      introduce them, he and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make,
      by them. If you have any more old horses, trot them out; any more tails,
      just cock them, and come at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat, I would not introduce this mode of discussion here; but I wish
      gentlemen on the other side to understand, that the use of degrading
      figures is a game at which they may find themselves unable to take all the
      winnings. ["We give it up."] Ay, you give it up, and well you may; but for
      a very different reason from that which you would have us understand. The
      point&mdash;the power to hurt&mdash;of all figures, consists in the <i>truthfulness</i>
      of their application; and, understanding this, you may well give it up.
      They are weapons which hit you, but miss us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, in my hurry, I was very near closing on this subject of military
      tails before I was done with it. There is one entire article of the sort I
      have not discussed yet; I mean the military tail you Democrats are now
      engaged in dovetailing on to the great Michigander. Yes, sir, all his
      biographers (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying him to a
      military tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of
      beans. True, the material is very limited, but they are at it might and
      main. He invaded Canada without resistance, and he <i>out</i>vaded it
      without pursuit. As he did both under orders, I suppose there was, to him,
      neither credit nor discredit; but they are made to constitute a large part
      of the tail. He was not at Hull's surrender, but he was close by; he was
      volunteer aid to Gen. Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames;
      and, as you said in 1840 Harrison was picking whortleberries two miles off
      while the battle was fought, I suppose it is a just conclusion, with you,
      to say Cass was aiding Harrison to pick whortleberries. This is about all,
      except the mooted question of the broken sword. Some authors say he broke
      it; some say he threw it away; and some others, who ought to know, say
      nothing about it. Perhaps it would be a fair historical compromise to say,
      if he did not break it, he did not do any thing else with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, Mr. Speaker, did you know I am a military hero? Yes sir: in
      the days of the Black-Hawk War, I fought, bled, and came away. Speaking of
      Gen. Cass's career reminds me of my own. I was not at Stillman's defeat,
      but I was about as near it as Cass was to Hull's surrender; and, like him,
      I saw the place very soon afterwards. It is quite certain I did not break
      my sword, for I had none to break; but I bent my musket pretty badly on
      one occasion. If Cass broke his sword, the idea is, he broke it in
      desperation: I bent the musket by accident. If Gen. Cass went in advance
      of me picking whortleberries,
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess I surpassed him in charges upon the wild onions. If he saw any
      live fighting Indians, it was more than I did, but I had a good many
      bloody struggles with the mosquitoes; and, although I never fainted from
      loss of blood, I can truly say I was often very hungry, "Mr. Speaker, if
      ever I should conclude to doff whatever our Democratic friends may suppose
      there is of black-cockade Federalism about me, and, thereupon, they shall
      take me up as their candidate for the Presidency, I protest that they
      shall not make fun of me, as they have of Gen. Cass, by attempting to
      write me into a military hero."

      Congress adjourned on the 14th of August; but Mr. Lincoln went up to New
      England, and made various campaign speeches before he returned home. They
      were not preserved, and were probably of little importance.

      Soon after his return to Washington, to take his seat at the second
      session of the Thirtieth Congress, he received a letter from his father,
      which astonished and perhaps amused him. His reply intimates grave doubts
      concerning the veracity of his correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, Dec. 24, 1848. My dear Father,&mdash;Your letter of the 7th
      was received night before last. I very cheerfully send you the twenty
      dollars, which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale. It is
      singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you; and it is
      more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long;
      particularly as I suppose you always had property enough to satisfy a
      judgment of that amount. Before you pay it, it would be well to be sure
      you have not paid, or at least that you cannot prove you have paid it.

      The second session was a quiet one. Mr. Lincoln did nothing to attract
      public attention in any marked degree. He attended diligently and
      unobtrusively to the ordinary duties of his office, and voted generally
      with the Whig majority. One Mr. Gott, however, of New York, offered a
      resolution looking to the abolition of the slave-trade in the District of
      Columbia, and Mr. Lincoln was one of only three or four Northern Whigs who
      voted to lay the resolution on the table. At another time, however, Mr.
      Lincoln proposed a substitute for the Gott resolution, providing for
      gradual and compensated emancipation, with the consent of the people of
      the District, to be ascertained at a general election. This measure he
      evidently abandoned, and it died a natural death among the rubbish of
      "unfinished business." His record on the Wilmot Proviso has been
      thoroughly exposed, both by himself and Mr. Douglas, and in the
      Presidential campaign by his friends and foes. He said himself, that he
      had voted for it "about forty-two times." It is not likely that he had
      counted the votes when he made this statement, but spoke according to the
      best of his "knowledge and belief."

      Dear Thompson,&mdash;A tirade is still kept up against me here for
      recommending T. R. King. This morning it is openly avowed that my supposed
      influence at Washington shall be broken down generally, and King's
      prospects defeated in particular. Now, what I have done in this matter, I
      have done at the request of you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I
      therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong, or come forward and sustain
      me. If the truth will permit, I propose that you sustain me in the
      following manner: copy the enclosed scrap in your own handwriting, and get
      everybody (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and
      then send it to me. Also, have six, eight, or ten of our best known Whig
      friends there to write me individual letters, stating the truth in this
      matter as they understand it. Don't neglect or delay in the matter. I
      understand information of an indictment having been found against him
      about three years ago for gaming, or keeping a gaming-house, has been sent
      to the Department. I shall try to take care of it at the Department till
      your action can be had and forwarded on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.

    <p>
      Dear William,&mdash;Your two letters were received last night. I have a
      great many letters to write, and so cannot write very long ones. There
      must be some mistake about Walter Davis saying I promised him the
      Post-office. I did not so promise him. I did tell him, that, if the
      distribution of the offices should fall into my hands, he should have
      something; and, if I shall be convinced he has said any more than this, I
      shall be disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said this much to him, because, as I understand, he is of good
      character, is one of the young men, is of the mechanics, and always
      faithful, and never troublesome, a Whig and is poor, with the support of a
      widow-mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother.
      If these are wrong reasons, then I have been wrong; but I have certainly
      not been selfish in it, because, in my greatest need of friends, he was
      against me and for Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      LIKE most other public men in America, Mr. Lincoln made his bread by the
      practice of his profession, and the better part of his fame by the
      achievements of the politician. He was a lawyer of some note, and,
      compared with the crowds who annually take upon themselves the responsible
      office of advocate and attorney, he might very justly have been called a
      good one; for he regarded his office as a trust, and selected and tried
      his cases, not with a view to personal gain, but to the administration of
      justice between suitors. And here, midway in his political career, it is
      well enough to pause, and take a leisurely survey of him in his other
      character of country lawyer, from the time he entered the bar at
      Springfield until he was translated from it to the Presidential chair. It
      is unnecessary to remind the reader (for by this time it must be obvious
      enough) that the aim of the writer is merely to present facts and
      contemporaneous opinions, with as little comment as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the courts and at the bar-meetings immediately succeeding his death,
      his professional brethren poured out in volumes their testimony to his
      worth and abilities as a lawyer. But, in estimating the value of this
      testimony, it is fair to consider the state of the public mind at the time
      it was given,&mdash;the recent triumph of the Federal arms under his
      direction; the late overwhelming indorsement of his administration; the
      unparalleled devotion of the people to his person as exhibited at the
      polls; the fresh and bitter memories of the hideous tragedy that took him
      off; the furious and deadly passions it inspired in the one party, and the
      awe, indignation, and terror it inspired in the other. It was no time for
      nice and critical examinations, either of his mental or his moral
      character; and it might have been attended with personal danger to attempt
      them. For days and nights together it was considered treason to be seen in
      public with a smile on the face. Men who spoke evil of the fallen chief,
      or even ventured a doubt concerning the ineffable purity and saintliness
      of his life, were pursued by mobs, were beaten to death with
      paving-stones, or strung up by the neck to lampposts. If there was any
      rivalry, it was as to who should be foremost and fiercest among his
      avengers, who should canonize him in the most solemn words, who should
      compare him to the most sacred character in all history, sacred and
      profane. He was prophet, priest, and king; he was Washington; he was
      Moses; and there were not wanting even those who likened him to the God
      and Redeemer of all the earth. These latter thought they discovered in his
      lowly origin, his kindly nature, his benevolent precepts, and the homely
      anecdotes in which he taught the people, strong points of resemblance
      between him and the divine Son of Mary. Even at this day, men are not
      wanting in prominent positions in life, who knew Mr. Lincoln well, and who
      do not hesitate to make such a comparison.

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/349.jpg" alt="Judge David Davis 349 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      For many years, Judge David Davis was the near friend and the intimate
      associate of Mr. Lincoln. He presided in the court where Lincoln was
      oftenest heard: year in and year out they travelled together from town to
      town, from county to county, riding frequently in the same conveyance, and
      lodging in the same room. Although a judge on the bench, Mr. Davis watched
      the political course of his friend with affectionate solicitude, and more
      than once interposed most effectually to advance his fortunes. When Mr.
      Lincoln ascended to the Presidency, it was well understood that no man
      enjoyed more confidential relations with him than Judge Davis. At the
      first opportunity, he commissioned Judge Davis an Associate Justice of
      that august tribunal, the Supreme Court of the United States; and, upon
      his death, Judge Davis administered upon his estate at the request of his
      family. Add to this the fact, that, among American jurists, Judge Davis's
      fame is, if not peerless, at least not excelled by that of any man whose
      reputation rests upon his labors as they appear in the books of Reports,
      and we may very fairly consider him a competent judge of the professional
      character of Mr. Lincoln. At Indianapolis, Judge Davis spoke of him as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I enjoyed for over twenty years the personal friendship of Mr. Lincoln.
      We were admitted to the bar about the same time, and travelled for many
      years what is known in Illinois as the Eighth Judicial Circuit. In 1848,
      when I first went on the bench, the circuit embraced fourteen counties,
      and Mr. Lincoln went with the court to every county. Railroads were not
      then in use, and our mode of travel was either on horseback or in buggies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This simple life he loved, preferring it to the practice of the law in a
      city, where, although the remuneration would be greater, the opportunity
      would be less for mixing with the great body of the people, who loved him,
      and whom he loved. Mr. Lincoln was transferred from the bar of that
      circuit to the office of President of the United States, having been
      without official position since he left Congress in 1849. In all the
      elements that constitute the great lawyer, he had few equals. He was great
      both at <i>nisi prius</i> and before an appellate tribunal. He seized the
      strong points of a cause, and presented them with clearness and great
      compactness. His mind was logical and direct, and he did not indulge in
      extraneous discussion. Generalities and platitudes had no charms for him.
      An unfailing vein of humor never deserted him; and he was always able to
      chain the attention of court and jury, when the cause was the most
      uninteresting, by the appropriateness of his anecdotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His power of comparison was large, and he rarely failed in a legal
      discussion to use that mode of reasoning. The framework of his mental and
      moral being was honesty, and a wrong cause was poorly defended by him. The
      ability which some eminent lawyers possess, of explaining away the bad
      points of a cause by ingenious sophistry, was denied him. In order to
      bring into full activity his great powers, it was necessary that he should
      be convinced of the right and justice of the matter which he advocated.
      When so convinced, whether the cause was great or small, he was usually
      successful. He read law-books but little, except when the cause in hand
      made it necessary; yet he was usually self-reliant, depending on his own
      resources, and rarely consulting his brother lawyers, either on the
      management of his case or on the legal questions involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln was the fairest and most accommodating of practitioners,
      granting all favors which he could do consistently with his duty to his
      client, and rarely availing himself of an unwary oversight of his
      adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hated wrong and oppression everywhere; and many a man whose fraudulent
      conduct was undergoing review in a court of justice has writhed under his
      terrific indignation and rebukes. He was the most simple and
      unostentatious of men in his habits, having few wants, and those easily
      supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To his honor be it said, that he never took from a client, even when the
      cause was gained, more than he thought the service was worth and the
      client could reasonably afford to pay. The people where he practised law
      were not rich, and his charges were always small.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he was elected President, I question whether there was a lawyer in
      the circuit, who had been at the bar as long a time, whose means were not
      larger. It did not seem to be one of the purposes of his life to
      accumulate a fortune. In fact, outside of his profession, he had no
      knowledge of the way to make money, and he never even attempted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln was loved by his brethren of the bar; and no body of men will
      grieve more at his death, or pay more sincere tributes to his memory. His
      presence on the circuit was watched for with interest, and never failed to
      produce joy and hilarity. When casually absent, the spirits of both bar
      and people were depressed. He was not fond of controversy, and would
      compromise a lawsuit whenever practicable."
    </p>
    <p>
      More or other evidence than this may, perhaps, be superfluous. Such an
      eulogium, from such a source, is more than sufficient to determine the
      place Mr. Lincoln is entitled to occupy in the history, or, more properly
      speaking, the traditions, of the Western bar. If Sir Matthew Hale had
      spoken thus of any lawyer of his day, he would have insured to the subject
      of his praise a place in the estimation of men only less conspicuous and
      honorable than that of the great judge himself. At the risk, however, of
      unnecessary accumulation, we venture to record an extract from Judge
      Drummond's address at Chicago:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a probity of character known to all, with an intuitive insight into
      the human heart, with a clearness of statement which was in itself an
      argument, with uncommon power and felicity of illustration,&mdash;often,
      it is true, of a plain and homely kind,&mdash;and with that sincerity and
      earnestness of manner which carried conviction, he was, perhaps, one of
      the most successful jury lawyers we ever had in the State. He always tried
      a case fairly and honestly. He never intentionally misrepresented the
      evidence of a witness, nor the argument of an opponent. He met both
      squarely, and, if he could not explain the one or answer the other,
      substantially admitted it. He never misstated the law, according to his
      own intelligent view of it. Such was the transparent candor and integrity
      of his nature, that he could not well, or strongly, argue a side or a
      cause that he thought wrong. Of course, he felt it his duty to say what
      could be said, and to leave the decision to others; but there could be
      seen in such cases the inward struggles of his own mind. In trying a case,
      he might occasionally dwell too long upon, or give too much importance to,
      an inconsiderable point; but this was the exception, and generally he went
      straight to the citadel of the cause or question, and struck home there,
      knowing, if that were won, the outworks would necessarily fall. He could
      hardly be called very learned in his profession, and yet he rarely tried a
      cause without fully understanding the law applicable to it; and I have no
      hesitation in saying he was one of the ablest lawyers I have ever known.
      If he was forcible before a jury, he was equally so with the court. He
      detected, with unerring sagacity, the weak points of an opponent's
      argument, and pressed his own views with overwhelming strength. His
      efforts were quite unequal; and it might happen that he would not, on some
      occasions, strike one as at all remarkable. But let him be thoroughly
      roused,&mdash;let him feel that he was right, and that some principle was
      involved in his cause,&mdash;and he would come out with an earnestness of
      conviction, a power of argument, and a wealth of illustration, that I have
      never seen surpassed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln's partnership with John T. Stuart began on the 27th of April,
      1837, and continued until the 14th of April, 1841, when it was dissolved,
      in consequence of Stuart's election to Congress. In that same year (1841),
      Mr. Lincoln united in practice with Stephen T. Logan, late presiding judge
      of the district, and they remained together until 1845.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards he formed a copartnership with William H. Herndon, his
      friend, familiar, and, we may almost say, biographer,&mdash;a connection
      which terminated only when the senior partner took an affectionate leave
      of the old circuit, the old office, home, friends, and all familiar
      things, to return no more until he came a blackened corpse. "He once told
      me of you," says Mr. Whitney in one of his letters to Mr. Herndon, "that
      he had taken you in as partner, supposing that you had a system, and would
      keep things in order, but that he found that you had no more system than
      he had, but that you were a fine lawyer; so that he was doubly
      disappointed." 1

        South Fork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds, which
        he says he left with you, but which I can find nothing of. Can you tell

      As already stated by Judge Davis, Mr. Lincoln was not "a great reader of
      law-books;" but what he knew he knew well, and within those limits was
      self-reliant and even intrepid. He was what is sometimes called "a
      case-lawyer,"&mdash;a man who reasoned almost entirely to the court and
      jury from analagous causes previously decided and reported in the books,
      and not from the elementary principles of the law, or the great underlying
      reasons for its existence. In consultation he was cautious, conscientious,
      and painstaking, and was seldom prepared to advise, except after careful
      and tedious examination of the authorities. He did not consider himself
      bound to take every case that was brought to him, nor to press all the
      points in favor of a client who in the main was right and entitled to
      recover. He is known to have been many times on the verge of quarrelling
      with old and valued friends, because he could not see the justice of their
      claims, and, therefore, could not be induced to act as their counsel.
      Henry McHenry, one of his New-Salem associates, brought him a case
      involving the title to a piece of land. McHenry had placed a family in a
      cabin which Mr. Lincoln believed to be situated on the other side of the
      adversary's line. He told McHenry that he must move the family out.
      "McHenry said he should not do it. 'Well,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'if you do
      not, I shall not attend to the suit.' McHenry said he did not care a d&mdash;n
      whether he did or not; that he (Lincoln) was not all the lawyer there was
      in town. Lincoln studied a while, and asked about the location of the
      cabin,... and then said, 'McHenry, you are right: I will attend to the
      suit,' and did attend to it, and gained it; and that was all the harsh
      words that passed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A citizen of Springfield," says Mr. Herndon, "who visited our office on
      business about a year before Mr. Lincoln's nomination, relates the
      following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. Lincoln was seated at his table, listening very attentively to a man
      who was talking earnestly in a low tone. After the would-be client had
      stated the facts of his case, Mr. Lincoln replied, "Yes, there is no
      reasonable doubt but that I can gain your case for you. I can set a whole
      neighborhood at loggerheads; I can distress a widowed mother and her six
      fatherless children, and thereby get for you six hundred dollars, which
      rightfully belongs, it appears to me, as much to the woman and her
      children as it does to you. You must remember that some things that are
      legally right are not morally right. I shall not take your case, but will
      give you a little advice, for which I will charge you nothing. You seem to
      be a sprightly, energetic man. I would advise you to try your hand at
      making six hundred dollars in some other way."'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1841, Mr. Lincoln was engaged in a curious case. The
      circumstances impressed him very deeply with the insufficiency and danger
      of "circumstantial evidence;" so much so, that he not only wrote the
      following account of it to Speed, but another more extended one, which was
      printed in a newspaper published at Quincy, 111. His mind was full of it:
      he could think of nothing else. It is apparent that in his letter to Speed
      he made no pause to choose his words: there is nothing constrained, and
      nothing studied or deliberate about it; but its simplicity, perspicuity,
      and artless grace make it a model of English composition. What Goldsmith
      once said of Locke may better be said of this letter: "He never says more
      nor less than he ought, and never makes use of a word that he could have
      changed for a better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, June 19,1841.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;We have had the highest state of excitement here for a
      week past that our community has ever witnessed; and although the public
      feeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very
      far from being over yet, cleared of mystery. It would take a quire of
      paper to give you any thing like a full account of it, and I therefore
      only propose a brief outline. The chief personages in the drama are
      Archibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry
      Trailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three
      Trailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town; the
      second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren County;
      and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had made his
      home with William. On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May, Fisher and
      William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there staid over
      Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry on horseback),
      and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter. That evening at
      supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some ineffectual search was
      made for him; and on Tuesday, at 1 o'clock, p.m., William and Henry
      started home without him. In a day or two Henry and one or two of his
      Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and advertised his
      disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the matter thus far had not
      been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about the 10th inst.,
      when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in Warren County, that
      William had arrived at home, and was telling a very mysterious and
      improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced the
      community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly. Keys made
      this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining
      county agog. And so it has continued until yesterday. The mass of the
      people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while Wickersbam
      was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim Maxcy to
      Warren to arrest William. On Monday last, Henry was brought in, and showed
      an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead, and
      that Arch, and William had killed him. He said he guessed the body could
      be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown Road and Hickox's mill.
      Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut down Hickox's
      mill-dam <i>nolens volens</i>, to draw the water out of the pond, and then
      went up and down, and down and up the creek, fishing and raking, and
      raking and ducking, and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead body
      found. In the mean time a sort of a scuffling-ground had been found in the
      brush in the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past
      the brewery, and the one leading in past the brick grove meet. From the
      scuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having
      been dragged to the edge of the thicket, where joined the track of some
      small wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the road-tracks.
      The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek. Near this drag-trail Dr.
      Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific examination, he
      pronounced to be triangular human hair, which term, he says, includes
      within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms, and on other
      parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the whiskers,
      because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the
      neighborhood of the razor's operations. On Thursday last Jim Maxcy brought
      in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch, was arrested, and
      put in jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his examining trial
      before May and Lavely. Archibald and Henry were both present. Lamborn
      prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant defended. A great
      many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I shall only mention
      those whose testimony seemed most important. The first of these was Capt.
      Ransdell. He swore, that, when William and Henry left Springfield for home
      on Tuesday before mentioned, they did not take the direct route,&mdash;which,
      you know, leads by the butcher-shop,&mdash;but that they followed the
      street north until they got opposite, or nearly opposite, May's new house,
      after which he could not see them from where he stood; and it was
      afterwards proved, that, in about an hour after they started, they came
      into the street by the butcher's shop from towards the brick-yard. Dr.
      Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffle-ground,
      drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage-tracks. Henry was then introduced by
      the prosecution. He swore, that, when they started for home, they went out
      north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west by the brick-yard into the
      woods, and there met Archibald; that they proceeded a small distance
      farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the
      approach of any one that might happen that way; that William and Arch,
      took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the
      thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them lift the body of a man into
      it; that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of
      Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for something like an hour, when
      William returned with the carriage, but without Arch., and said they had
      put him in a safe place; that they went somehow, he did not know exactly
      how, into the road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's
      Grove. He also stated that some time during the day William told him that
      he and Arch, had killed Fisher the evening before; that the way they did
      it was by him (William) knocking him down with a club, and Arch, then
      choking him to death. An old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then
      introduced on the part of the defence. He swore that he had known Fisher
      for several years; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at
      each of two different spells,&mdash;once while he built a barn for him,
      and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three
      years ago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun,
      since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional
      aberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same
      day that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home in
      the early part of the day, and on his return, about 11 o'clock, found
      Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he asked him
      how he had come from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria,
      and also told of several other places he had been at, more in the
      direction of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did not
      know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement. He
      further stated, that in about two hours he received a note from one of
      Trail-or's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go
      on to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's
      health in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two of his
      neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night, overtook
      Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton. County; That Maxcy refusing to
      discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned, and he
      came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to whether the
      doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his (among
      whom was the same postmaster who wrote to Keys, as before mentioned) were
      introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they knew the doctor to
      be of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good
      character in every way. Here the testimony ended, and the Trailors were
      discharged, Arch, and William expressing, both in word and manner, their
      entire confidence that Fisher would be found alive at the doctor's by
      Galloway, Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been despatched for
      that purpose; while Henry still protested that no power on earth could
      ever show Fisher alive. Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor's
      story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the
      countenances, and hear the remarks, of those who had been actively engaged
      in the search for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy,
      and some furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he
      always knew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to
      hunt for him: Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's
      mill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully
      woebegone; he seemed the "<i>wictim of hunrequited affection</i>," as
      represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over. And Hart, the
      little drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad to
      have so much trouble, and no hanging, after all.

      I commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of the
      13th. I stick to my promise to come to Louisville. Nothing new here,
      except what I have written. I have not seen&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;since my
      last trip; and I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours forever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 3d of December, 1839, Mr. Lincoln was admitted to practice in the
      Circuit Court of the United States; and on the same day the names of
      Stephen A. Douglas, S. H. Treat, Schuyler Strong, and two other gentlemen,
      were placed on the same roll. The "Little Giant" is always in sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first speech he delivered in the Supreme Court of the State was one
      the like of which will never be heard again, and must have led the judges
      to doubt the sanity of the new attorney. We give it in the form in which
      it seems to be authenticated by Judge Treat:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A case being called for hearing in the Court, Mr. Lincoln stated that he
      appeared for the appellant, and was ready to proceed with the argument. He
      then said, 'This is the first case I have ever had in this court, and I
      have therefore examined it with great care. As the Court will perceive, by
      looking at the abstract of, the record, the only question in the case is
      one of authority. I have not been able to find any authority sustaining <i>my</i>
      side of the case, but I <i>have found</i> several cases directly in point
      on the <i>other</i> side. I will now give <i>these</i> cases, and then
      submit the case.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The testimony of all the lawyers, his contemporaries and rivals, is in the
      same direction. "But Mr. Lincoln's love of justice and fair play," says
      Mr. Gillespie, "was his predominating trait. I have often listened to him
      when I thought he would certainly state his case out of Court. It was not
      in his nature to assume, or to attempt to bolster up, a false position. He
      would abandon his case first. He did so in the case of Buckmaster for the
      use of Denham vs. Beenes and Arthur, in our Supreme Court, in which I
      happened to be opposed to him. Another gentleman, less fastidious, took
      Mr. Lincoln's place, and gained the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Patterson trial&mdash;a case of murder which attained some
      celebrity&mdash;in Champaign County, Ficklin and Lamon prosecuted, and
      Lincoln and Swett defended. After hearing the testimony, Mr. Lincoln felt
      himself morally paralyzed, and said, "Swett, the man is guilty: you defend
      him; I can't." They got a fee of five hundred or a thousand dollars; of
      which Mr. Lincoln declined to take a cent, on the ground that it justly
      belonged to Swett, whose ardor, courage, and eloquence had saved the
      guilty man from justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably his deep sense of natural justice, his irresistible
      propensity to get at the equities of the matter in hand, that made him so
      utterly impatient of all arbitrary or technical rules. Of these he knew
      very little,&mdash;less than an average student of six months: "Hence,"
      says Judge Davis, "a child could make use of the simple and technical
      rules, the means and mode of getting at justice, better than Lincoln
      could." "In this respect," says Mr. Herndon, "I really think he was very
      deficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sangamon County was originally in the First Judicial Circuit; but under
      the Constitution of 1848, and sundry changes in the Judiciary Acts, it
      became the Eighth Circuit. It was in 1848 that Judge Davis came on the
      bench for the first time. The circuit was a very large one, containing
      fourteen counties, and comprising the central portion of the State.
      Lincoln travelled all over it&mdash;first with Judge Treat and then with
      Judge Davis&mdash;twice every year, and was thus absent from Springfield
      and home nearly, if not quite, six months out of every twelve. "In my
      opinion," says Judge Davis, "Lincoln was as happy as <i>he</i> could be,
      on this circuit, and happy in no other place. This was his place of
      enjoyment. As a general rule, of a Saturday evening, when all the lawyers
      would go home [the judge means those who were close enough to get there
      and back by the time their cases were called] and see their families and
      friends, Lincoln would refuse to go." "It was on this circuit," we are
      told by an authority equally high, "that he shone as a <i>nisi prius</i>
      lawyer; it was on this circuit Lincoln thought, spoke, and acted; it was
      on this circuit that the people met, greeted, and cheered on the man; it
      was on this circuit that he cracked his jokes, told his stories, made his
      money, and was happy as nowhere in the world beside." When, in 1857,
      Sangamon County was cut off from the Eighth Circuit by the act creating
      the Eighteenth, "Mr. Lincoln would still continue with Judge Davis, first
      finishing his business in Sangamon."
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return from one of these long journeys, he found that Mrs. Lincoln
      had taken advantage of his absence, and, with the connivance and
      assistance of his neighbor, Gourly, had placed a second story and a new
      roof on his house. Approaching it for the first time after this rather
      startling alteration, and pretending not to recognize it, he called to a
      man on the street, "Stranger, can you tell me where Lincoln lives? He used
      to live here."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Lincoln first began to "ride the circuit," he was too poor to own
      horseflesh or vehicle, and was compelled to borrow from his friends. But
      in due time he became the proprietor of a horse, which he fed and groomed
      himself, and to which he was very much attached. On this animal he would
      set out from home, to be gone for weeks together, with no baggage but a
      pair of saddle-bags, containing a change of linen, and an old cotton
      umbrella, to shelter him from sun or rain. When he got a little more of
      this world's goods, he set up a one-horse buggy,&mdash;a very sorry and
      shabby-looking affair, which he generally used when the weather promised
      to be bad. But the lawyers were always glad to see him, and the landlords
      hailed his coming with pleasure. Yet he was one of those peculiar, gentle,
      uncomplaining men, whom those servants of the public who keep "hotels"
      would generally put off with the most indifferent accommodations. It was a
      very significant remark of a lawyer thoroughly acquainted with his habits
      and disposition, that "Lincoln was never seated next the landlord at a
      crowded table, and never got a chicken liver or the best cut from the
      roast." If rooms were scarce, and one, two, three, or four gentlemen were
      required to lodge together, in order to accommodate some surly man who
      "stood upon his rights," Lincoln was sure to be one of the unfortunates.
      Yet he loved the life, and never went home without reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Mr. S. O. Parks of Lincoln, himself a most reputable lawyer, we have
      two or three anecdotes, which we give in his own language:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have often said, that, for a man who was for the quarter of a century
      both a lawyer and a politician, he was the most honest man I ever knew. He
      was not only morally honest, but intellectually so. He could not reason
      falsely: if he attempted it, he failed. In politics he never would try to
      mislead. At the bar, when he thought he was wrong, he was the weakest
      lawyer I ever saw. You know this better than I do. But I will give you an
      example or two which occurred in this county, and which you may not
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man was indicted for larceny: Lincoln, Young, and myself defended him.
      Lincoln was satisfied by the evidence that he was guilty, and ought to be
      convicted. He called Young and myself aside, and said, 'If you can say any
      thing for the man, do it. I can't: if I attempt, the jury will see that I
      think he is guilty, and convict him, of course.' The case was submitted by
      us to the jury without a word. The jury failed to agree; and before the
      next term the man died. Lincoln's honesty undoubtedly saved him from the
      penitentiary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a closely-contested civil suit, Lincoln had proved an account for his
      client, who was, though he did not know it at the time, a very slippery
      fellow. The opposing attorney then proved a receipt clearly covering the
      entire cause of action. By the time he was through, Lincoln was missing.
      The court sent for him to the hotel. 'Tell the judge,' said he, 'that I
      can't come: <i>my hands are dirty; and I came over to clean them!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the case of Harris and Jones vs. Buckles, Harris wanted Lincoln to
      assist you and myself. His answer was characteristic: 'Tell Harris it's no
      use to <i>waste money on me</i> in that case: he'll get beat.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was prone to adventures in which <i>pigs</i> were the other
      party. The reader has already enjoyed one from the pen of Miss Owen; and
      here is another, from an incorrigible humorist, a lawyer, named J. H.
      Wickizer:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In 1855 Mr. Lincoln and myself were travelling by buggy from Woodford
      County Court to Bloomington, 111.; and, in passing through a little grove,
      we suddenly heard the terrific squealing of a little pig near by us. Quick
      as thought Mr. Lincoln leaped out of the buggy, seized a club, pounced
      upon the old sow, and beat her lustily: she was in the act of eating one
      of her young ones. Thus he saved the pig, and then remarked, 'By jing! the
      unnatural old brute shall not devour her own progeny!' This, I think, was
      his first proclamation of freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Wickizer gives us another story, which most happily illustrates
      the readiness of Mr. Lincoln's wit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In 1858, in the court at Bloomington, Mr. Lincoln was engaged in a case
      of no great importance; but the attorney on the other side, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      a young lawyer of fine abilities (now a judge of the Supreme Court of the
      State), was always very sensitive about being beaten, and in this case
      manifested unusual zeal and interest. The case lasted until late at night,
      when it was finally submitted to the jury. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;spent
      a sleepless night in anxiety, and early next morning learned, to his great
      chagrin, that he had lost the case. Mr. Lincoln met him at the Court
      House, and asked him what had become of his case. With lugubrious
      countenance and melancholy tone, Mr. S-said, 'It's gone to hell.'&mdash;'Oh,
      well!' replied Lincoln, 'then you'll see it again!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the humble condition and disreputable character of some of his
      relations and connections were the subject of constant annoyance and most
      painful reflections, he never tried to shake them off, and never abandoned
      them when they needed his assistance. A son of his foster-brother, John
      Johnston, was arrested in&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;County for stealing a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln went to the same town to address a mass meeting while the poor
      boy was in jail. He waited until the dusk of the evening, and then, in
      company with Mr. H. C. Whitney, visited the prison. "Lincoln knew he was
      guilty," says Mr. Whitney, "and was very deeply affected,&mdash;more than
      I ever saw him. At the next term of the court, upon the State's Attorney's
      consent, Lincoln and I went to the prosecution witnesses, and got them to
      come into open court, and state that they did not care to presecute." The
      boy was released; and that evening, as the lawyers were leaving the town
      in their buggies, Mr. Lincoln was observed to get down from his, and walk
      back a short distance to a poor, distressed-looking young man who stood by
      the roadside. It was young Johnston. Mr. Lincoln engaged for a few moments
      apparently in earnest and nervous conversation with him, then giving him
      some money, and returning to his buggy, drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand tales could be told of Mr. Lincoln's amusing tricks and
      eccentricities on these quiet rides from county to county, in company with
      judges and lawyers, and of his quaint sayings and curious doings at the
      courts in these Western villages. But, much against our will, we are
      compelled to make selections, and present a few only, which rest upon the
      most undoubted authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that he used to carry with him, on what Mr. Stuart calls
      "the tramp around the circuit," ordinary school-books,&mdash;from Euclid
      down to an English grammar,&mdash;and study them as he rode along, or at
      intervals of leisure in the towns where he stopped. He supplemented these
      with a copy of Shakspeare, got much of it by rote, and recited long
      passages from it to any chance companion by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was intensely fond of cutting wood with an axe; and he was often seen
      to jump from his buggy, seize an axe out of the hands of a roadside
      chopper, take his place on the log in the most approved fashion, and, with
      his tremendous long strokes, cut it in two before the man could recover
      from his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this free life that charmed him, and reconciled him to existence.
      Here he forgot the past, with all its cruelties and mortifications: here
      were no domestic afflictions to vex his weary spirit and to try his
      magnanimous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After he had returned from Congress," says Judge Davis, "and had lost his
      practice, Goodrich of Chicago proposed to him to open a law-office in
      Chicago, and go into partnership with him. Goodrich had an extensive
      practice there. Lincoln refused to accept, and gave as a reason, that he
      tended to consumption; that, if he went to Chicago, he would have to sit
      down and study hard, and it would kill him; that he would rather go around
      the circuit&mdash;the Eighth Judicial Circuit&mdash;than to sit down and
      die in Chicago."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1857, at a camp-meeting in Mason County, one Metzgar was
      most brutally murdered. The affray took place about half a mile from the
      place of worship, near some wagons loaded with liquors and provisions. Two
      men, James H. Norris and William D. Armstrong, were indicted for the
      crime. Norris was tried in Mason County, convicted of manslaughter, and
      sentenced to the penitentiary for the term of eight years. But Armstrong,
      the popular feeling being very high against him in Mason, "took a change
      of venue to Cass County," and was there tried (at Beardstown) in the
      spring of 1858. Hitherto Armstrong had had the services of two able
      counsellors, but now their efforts were supplemented by those of a most
      determined and zealous volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong was the son of Jack and Hannah Armstrong of New Salem, the child
      whom Mr. Lincoln had rocked in the cradle while Mrs. Armstrong attended to
      other household duties. His life was now in imminent peril: he seemed
      clearly guilty; and, if he was to be saved, it must be by the
      interposition of some power which could deface that fatal record in the
      Norris trial, refute the senses of witnesses, and make a jury forget
      themselves and their oaths. Old Hannah had one friend whom she devoutly
      believed could accomplish this. She wrote to Mr. Lincoln, and he replied
      that he would defend the boy. (She says she has lost his letter.)
      Afterwards she visited him at Springfield, and prepared him for the event
      as well as she could, with an understanding weakened by a long strain of
      severe and almost hopeless reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trial came on, Mr. Lincoln appeared for the defence. His
      colleague, Mr. Walker, had possessed him of the record in the Norris case;
      and, upon close and anxious examination, he was satisfied that the
      witnesses could, by a well-sustained and judicious cross-examination, be
      made to contradict each other in some important particulars. Mr. Walker
      "handled" the victims of this friendly design, while Mr. Lincoln sat by
      and suggested questions. Nevertheless, to the unskilled mind, the
      testimony seemed to be absolutely conclusive against the prisoner, and
      every word of it fell like a new sentence of death. Norris had beaten the
      murdered man with a club from behind, while Armstrong had pounded him in
      the face with a slung-shot deliberately prepared for the occasion; and,
      according to the medical men, either would have been fatal without the
      other. But the witness whose testimony bore hardest upon Armstrong swore
      that the crime was committed about eleven o'clock at night, and that he
      saw the blows struck by the light of a moon nearly full, and standing in
      the heavens about where the sun would stand at ten o'clock in the morning.
      It is easy to pervert and even to destroy evidence like this; and here Mr.
      Lincoln saw an opportunity which nobody had dreamed of on the Norris
      trial. He handed to an officer of the court an almanac, and told him to
      give it back to him when he should call for it in presence of the jury. It
      was an almanac of the year previous to the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln," says Mr. Walker, "made the closing argument for the
      defence. At first he spoke slowly, and carefully reviewed the whole
      testimony,&mdash;picked it all to pieces, and showed that the man had not
      received his wounds at the place or time named by the witnesses, <i>but
      afterwards, and at the hands of some one else</i>" "The evidence bore
      heavily upon his client," says Mr. Shaw, one of the counsel for the
      prosecution. "There were many witnesses, and each one seemed to add one
      more cord that seemed to bind him down, until Mr. Lincoln was something in
      the situation of Gulliver after his first sleep in Lilliput. But, when he
      came to talk to the jury (that was always his forte), he resembled
      Gulliver again. He skilfully untied here and there a knot, and loosened
      here and there a peg, until, fairly getting warmed up, he raised himself
      in his full power, and shook the arguments of his opponents from him as if
      they were cobwebs." In due time he called for the almanac, and easily
      proved by it, that, at the time the main witness declared the moon was
      shining in great splendor, there was, in fact, no moon at all, but black
      darkness over the whole scene. In the "roar of laughter" and undisguised
      astonishment succeeding this apparent demonstration, court, jury, and
      counsel forgot to examine that seemingly conclusive almanac, and let it
      pass without a question concerning its genuineness.1
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, Mr. Lincoln drew a touching picture of Jack Armstrong
      (whose gentle spirit alas! had gone to that place of coronation for the
      meek), and Hannah,&mdash;this sweet-faced old lady with the silver locks,&mdash;welcoming
      to their humble cabin a strange and penniless boy, to whom Jack, with that
      Christian benevolence which distinguished him through life, became as a
      father, and the guileless Hannah even more than a mother. The boy, he
      said, stood before them pleading for the life of his benefactors' son,&mdash;the
      staff of the widow's declining years.

        1 Mr. E. J. Loomis, assistant in charge of the "Nautical Almanac"
        office, Washington, D.C., under date of Aug. 1,1871, says,&mdash;
        "Referring to the 'Nautical Almanac' for 1857, I find, that, between the
        hours of ten and eleven o'clock on the night of the 29th of August,
        1857, the moon was within one hour of setting. "The computed time of its
        setting on that night is 11 h. 57 m.,&mdash;three minutes before
        midnight. "The moon was only two days past its first quarter, and could
        hardly be mistaken for 'nearly full.'" "In the case of the People vs.
        Armstrong, I was assisting prosecuting counsel. The prevailing belief at
        that time, and I may also say at the present, in Cass County, was as
        follows:&mdash; "Mr. Lincoln, previous to the trial, handed an almanac
        of the year previous to the murder to an officer of the court, stating
        that he might call for one during the trial, and, if he did, to send him
        that one. An important witness for the People had fixed the time of the
        murder to be in the night, near a camp-meeting; 'that the moon was about
        in the same place that the sun would be at ten o'clock in the morning,
        and was nearly full,'therefore he could see plainly, &amp;c. At the
        proper time, Mr. Lincoln called to the officer for an almanac; and the
        one prepared for the occasion was shown by Mr. 'Lincoln, he reading from
        it at the time referred to by the witness 'The moon had already set;'
        that in the roar of laughter the jury and opposing counsel forgot to
        look at the date. Mr. Carter, a lawyer of this city (Beardstown), who
        was present at, but not engaged in, the Armstrong case, says he is
        satisfied that the almanac was of the year previous, and thinks he
        examined it at the time. This was the general impression in the
        court-room. I have called on the sheriff who officiated at that time
        (James A. Dick), who says that he saw a 'Goudy's Almanac' lying upon Mr.
        Lincoln's table during the trial, and that Mr. Lincoln took it out of
        his own pocket. Mr. Dick does not know the date of it. I have seen
        several of the petit jurymen who sat upon the case, who only recollect
        that the almanac floored the witness. But one of the jurymen, the
        foreman, Mr. Milton Logan, says that it was the one for the year of the
        murder, and no trick about it; that he is willing to make an affidavit
        that he examined it as to date, and that it was an almanac of the year
        of the murder. My own opinion is, that when an almanac was called for by
        Mr. Lincoln, two were brought, one of the year of the murder, and one of
        the year previous; that Mr. Lincoln was entirely innocent of any
        deception in the matter. I the more think this, from the fact that
        Armstrong was not cleared by any want of testimony against him, but by
        the irresistible appeal of Mr. Lincoln in his favor."&mdash;Henry Shaw.

    <p>
      "The last fifteen minutes of his speech," his colleague declares, "was as
      eloquent as I ever heard; and such the power and earnestness with which he
      spoke to that jury, that all sat as if entranced, and, when he was
      through, found relief in a gush of tears." "He took the jury by storm,"
      says one of the prosecutors. "There were tears in Mr. Lincoln's eyes while
      he spoke, but they were genuine. His sympathies were fully enlisted in
      favor of the young man, and his terrible sincerity could not help but
      arouse the same passion in the jury. I have said a hundred times that it
      was Lincoln's speech that saved that criminal from the gallows." In the
      language of Hannah, who sat by enchanted, "he told the stories about our
      first acquaintance,&mdash;what I did for him, and how I did it;" and she
      thinks it "was truly eloquent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the trial," continues Hannah, "Lincoln said to me, 'Hannah, your
      son will be cleared before sundown.' He and the other lawyers addressed
      the jury, and closed the case. I went down at Thompson's pasture: Stator
      came to me, and told me soon that my son was cleared and a free man. I
      went up to the Court House: the jury shook hands with me, so did the
      Court, so did Lincoln. We were all affected, and tears, streamed down
      Lincoln's eyes. He then remarked to me, 'Hannah, what did I tell you? I
      pray to God that William may be a good boy hereafter; that this lesson may
      prove in the end a good lesson to him and to all.'... After the trial was
      over, Lincoln came down to where I was in Beardstown. I asked him what he
      charged me; told him I was poor. He said, 'Why, Hannah, I sha'n't charge
      you a cent,&mdash;never. Any thing I can do for you I will do for you
      willing and freely without charges.' He wrote to me about some land which
      some men were trying to get from me, and said, 'Hannah, they can't get
      your land. Let them try it in the Circuit Court, and then you appeal it;
      bring it to Supreme Court, and I and Herndon will attend to it for
      nothing.'"

      This boy William enlisted in the Union army. But in 1863 Hannah concluded
      she "wanted" him. She does not say that William was laboring under any
      disability, or that he had any legal right to his discharge. She merely
      "wanted" him, and wrote Mr. Lincoln to that effect. He replied promptly by
      telegraph:&mdash;

      For many years Mr. Lincoln was the attorney of the Illinois Central
      Railway Company; and, having rendered in some recent causes most important
      and laborious services, he presented a bill in 1857 for five thousand
      dollars. He pressed for his money, and was referred to some under-official
      who was charged with that class of business. Mr. Lincoln would probably
      have modified his bill, which seemed exorbitant as charges went among
      country lawyers, but the company treated him with such rude insolence,
      that he contented himself with a formal demand, and then immediately
      instituted suit on the claim. The case was tried at Bloomington before
      Judge Davis; and, upon affidavits of N. B. Judd, O. H.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browning, S. T. Logan, and Archy Williams, respecting the value of the
      services, was decided in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment given for
      five thousand dollars. This was much more money than Mr. Lincoln had ever
      had at one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1859 Mr. Lincoln went to Cincinnati to argue the
      celebrated McCormick reaping-machine case. Mr. Edwin M. Stanton, whom he
      never saw before, was one of his colleagues, and the leading counsel in
      the case; and although the other gentlemen engaged received him with
      proper respect, Mr. Stanton treated him with such marked and habitual
      discourtesy, that he was compelled to withdraw from the case. When he
      reached home he said that he had "never been so brutally treated as by
      that man Stanton;" and the facts justified the statement.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE have seen already, from one of his letters to Mr. Herndon, that Mr.
      Lincoln was personally quite willing to be a candidate for Congress the
      second time. But his "honor" forbade: he had given pledges, and made
      private arrangements with other gentlemen, to prevent "the district from
      going to the enemy." Judge Logan was nominated in his place; and, although
      personally one of the most popular men in Illinois, he was sadly beaten,
      in consequence of the record which the Whig party had made "against the
      war." It was well as it was; for, if Mr. Lincoln had been the candidate,
      he would have been still more disastrously defeated, since it was mainly
      the votes he had given in Congress which Judge Logan found it so difficult
      to explain and impossible to defend.

      Mr. Lincoln was an applicant, and a very urgent one, for the office of
      Commissioner of the General Land-Office in the new Whig administration. He
      moved his friends to urge him in the newspapers, and wrote to some of his
      late associates in Congress (among them Mr. Schenck of Ohio), soliciting
      their support. But it was all of no avail; Mr. Justin Butterfield (also an
      Illinoisian) beat him in the race to Washington, and got the appointment.
      It is said by one of Mr. Lincoln's numerous biographers, that he often
      laughed over his failure to secure this great office, pretending to think
      it beneath his merits; but we can find no evidence of the fact alleged,
      and have no reason to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fillmore subsequently offered him the governorship of Oregon. The news
      reached him whilst away at court at Tremont or Bloomington. Mr. Stuart and
      others "coaxed him to take it;" the former insisting that Oregon would
      soon become a State, and he one of its senators. Mr. Lincoln saw it all,
      and said he would accept "if his wife would consent." But his wife
      "refused to do so;" and time has shown that she was right, as she usually
      was when it came to a question of practical politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of his retirement from Congress to 1854, when the repeal of
      the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill broke the hollow
      truce of 1856, which Mr. Clay and his compeers fondly regarded as a peace,
      Mr. Lincoln's life was one of comparative political inactivity. He did not
      believe that the sectional agitations could be permanently stilled by the
      devices which then seemed effectual to the foremost statesmen of either
      party and of both sections. But he was not disposed to be forward in the
      renewal of them. He probably hoped against conviction that time would
      allay the animosities which endangered at once the Union and the
      principles of free government, which had thus far preserved a precarious
      existence among the North American States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming home to Springfield from the Tremont court in 1850 in company with
      Mr. Stuart, he said, "The time will come when we must all be Democrats or
      Abolitionists. When that time comes, my mind is made up. The 'slavery
      question' can't be compromised."&mdash;"So is my mind made up," replied
      his equally firm companion; and at that moment neither doubted on which
      side he would find the other when the great struggle took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Whig party everywhere, in Congress and in their conventions, local and
      national, accepted the compromise of 1850 under the leadership of Mr. Clay
      and Mr. Webster. Mr. Lincoln did the same; for, from the hour that party
      lines were distinctly and closely drawn in his State, he was an unswerving
      party man. But although he said nothing against those measures, and much
      in favor of them, it is clear that he accepted the result with reluctance.
      He spoke out his disapproval of the Fugitive Slave Law as it was passed,
      believing and declaring wherever he went, that a negro man apprehended as
      a slave should have the privilege of a trial by jury, instead of the
      summary processes provided by the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln and I were going to Petersburg in 1850, I think," says Mr.
      Herndon. "The political world was dead: the compromises of 1850 seemed to
      settle the negro's fate. Things were stagnant; and all hope for progress
      in the line of freedom seemed to be crushed out. Lincoln was speculating
      with me about the deadness of things, and the despair which arose out of
      it, and deeply regretting that his human strength and power were limited
      by his nature to rouse and stir up the world. He said gloomily,
      despairingly, sadly, 'How hard, oh! how hard it is to die and leave one's
      country no better than if one had never lived for it! The world is dead to
      hope, deaf to its own death-struggle, made known by a universal cry, What
      is to be done? Is any thing to be done? Who can do any thing? and how is
      it to be done? Did you ever think of these things?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1850 Mr. Lincoln again declined to be a candidate for Congress; and a
      newspaper called "The Tazewell Mirror" persisting in naming him for the
      place, he published a letter, refusing most emphatically to be considered
      a candidate. The concluding sentence alleged that there were many men
      among the Whigs of the district who would be as likely as he to bring "the
      district right side up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the death of his excellent step-mother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, Mr.
      Lincoln never considered himself free for a moment from the obligation to
      look after and care for her family. She had made herself his mother; and
      he regarded her and her children as near relatives,&mdash;much nearer than
      any of the Hankses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit of Thomas Lincoln's life was rapidly approaching. Mrs. Chapman,
      his step-daughter, wrote Mr. Lincoln to that effect; and so did John
      Johnston. He began to fear that the straitened circumstances of the
      household might make them think twice before they sent for a doctor, or
      procured other comforts for the poor old man, which he needed, perhaps,
      more than drugs. He was too busy to visit the dying man, but sent him a
      kind message, and directed the family to get whatever was wanted upon his
      credit.

      Dear Brother,&mdash;On the day before yesterday I received a letter from
      Harriet, written at Greenup. She says she has just returned from your
      house, and that father is very low, and will hardly recover. She also says
      that you have written me two letters, and that, although you do not expect
      me to come now, you wonder that I do not write. I received both your
      letters; and, although I have not answered them, it is not because I have
      forgotten them, or not been interested about them, but because it appeared
      to me I could write nothing which could do any good. You already know I
      desire that neither father nor mother shall be in want of any comfort,
      either in health or sickness, while they live; and I feel sure you have
      not failed to use my name, if necessary, to procure a doctor or any thing
      else for father in his present sickness. My business is such that I could
      hardly leave home now, if it were not, as it is, that my own wife is sick
      a-bed. (It is a case of baby sickness, and, I suppose, is not dangerous.)
      I sincerely hope father may yet recover his health; but, at all events,
      tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and good and
      merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity. He notes
      the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads; and he will not
      forget the dying man who puts his trust in him. Say to him, that, if we
      could meet now, it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful than
      pleasant; but that, if it be his lot to go now, he will soon have a joyous
      meeting with loved ones gone before, and where the rest of us, through the
      help of God, hope ere long to join them.

      Before and after the death of Thomas Lincoln, John Johnston and Mr.
      Lincoln had a somewhat spirited correspondence regarding John's present
      necessities and future plans. John was idle, thriftless, penniless, and as
      much disposed to rove as poor old Tom had been in his earliest and worst
      days. This lack of character and enterprise on John's part added seriously
      to Mr. Lincoln's anxieties concerning his step-mother, and greatly
      embarrassed his attempts to provide for her. At length he wrote John the
      following energetic exhortation, coupled with a most magnanimous pecuniary
      offer. It is the letter promised in a previous chapter, and makes John an

      Dear Johnston,&mdash;Your request for eighty dollars, I do not think it
      best to comply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a
      little, you have said to me, "We can get along very well now;" but in a
      very short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can
      only happen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I
      know. You are not <i>lazy</i>, and still you are an <i>idler</i>. I doubt
      whether, since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work in any one
      day. You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much,
      merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.
      This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; and it is
      vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you
      should break the habit. It is more important to them, because they have
      longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it
      easier than they can get out after they are in.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall
      go to work, "tooth and nail," for somebody who will give you money for it.
      Let father and your boys take charge of things at home, prepare for a
      crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money-wages, or
      in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and, to secure you a
      fair reward for your labor, I now promise you, that, for every dollar you
      will, between this and the first of next May, get for your own labor,
      either in money or as your own indebtedness, I will then give you one
      other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from
      me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In
      this I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead-mines, or
      the gold-mines in California; but I mean for you to go at it for the best
      wages you can get close to home, in Cole's County. Now, if you will do
      this, you will be soon out of debt, and, what is better, you will have a
      habit that will keep you from getting in debt again. But, if I should now
      clear you out of debt, next year you would be just as deep in as ever. You
      say you would almost give your place in heaven for $70 or $80. Then you
      value your place in heaven very cheap; for I am sure you can, with the
      offer I make, get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months'
      work. You say, if I will furnish you the money, you will deed me the land,
      and, if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession.
      Nonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live
      without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not mean to be
      unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will
      find it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you.

      Again he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelbyville, Nov. 4, 1851.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Brother,&mdash;When I came into Charleston day before yesterday, I
      learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live, and move to
      Missouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think
      such a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri better than
      here? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than here, raise
      corn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there, any more than
      here, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work, there is no
      better place than right where you are: if you do not intend to go to work,
      you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from place to
      place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year; and what you
      really want is to sell the land, get the money, and spend it. Part with
      the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after own a spot
      big enough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you will spend
      in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat and drink and wear
      out, and no foot of land will be bought. Now, I feel it is my duty to have
      no hand in such a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so even on your own
      account, and particularly on <i>mother's</i> account. The eastern forty
      acres I intend to keep for mother while she lives: if you <i>will not
      cultivate it</i>, it will rent for enough to support her; at least, it
      will rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties she can let
      you have, and no thanks to me. Now, do not misunderstand this letter: I do
      not write it in any unkindness. I write it in order, if possible, to get
      you to <i>face</i> the truth, which truth is, you are destitute because
      you have idled away all your time. Your thousand pretences for not getting
      along better are all nonsense: they deceive nobody but yourself. <i>Go to
      work</i> is the only cure for your case.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word to mother. Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.
      If I were you, I would try it a while. If you get tired of it (as I think
      you will not), you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very kindly
      to you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely your son,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.

      Shelbyville, Nov. 9,1851.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Brother,&mdash;When I wrote you before, I had not received your
      letter. I still think as I did; but if the land can be sold so that I get
      three hundred dollars to put to interest for mother, I will not object, if
      she does not. But, before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or
      secured beyond all doubt, at ten per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Abram, I do not want him, <i>on my own account</i>; but I understand
      he wants to live with me, so that he can go to school, and get a fair
      start in the world, which I very much wish him to have. When I reach home,
      if I can make it convenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no
      mistake between us as to the object and terms of my taking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In haste as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of July, 1852, Mr. Lincoln was chosen by a public meeting of
      his fellow-citizens at Springfield to deliver in their hearing a eulogy
      upon the life and character of Henry Clay; and on the 16th of the same
      month he complied with their request. Such addresses are usually called
      orations; but this one scarcely deserved the name. He made no effort to be
      eloquent, and in no part of it was he more than ordinarily animated. It is
      true that he bestowed great praise upon Mr. Clay; but it was bestowed in
      cold phrases and a tame style, wholly unlike the bulk of his previous
      compositions. In truth, Mr. Lincoln was never so devoted a follower of Mr.
      Clay as some of his biographers have represented him. He was for another
      man in 1836, most probably for another in 1840, and very ardently for
      another in 1848. Dr. Holland credits him with a visit to Mr. Clay at
      Ashland, and an interview which effectually cooled his ardor in behalf of
      the brilliant statesman. But, in fact, Mr. Lincoln never troubled himself
      to make such a pilgrimage to see or hear any man,&mdash;much less Mr.
      Clay. None of his friends&mdash;Judge Davis, Mr. Herndon, Mr. Speed, or
      any one else, so far as we are able to ascertain&mdash;ever heard of the
      visit. If it had been made at any time after 1838, it could scarcely have
      been concealed from Mr. Speed; and we are compelled to place it along with
      the multitude of groundless stories which have found currency with Mr.
      Lincoln's biographers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the address upon Clay is of any historical value at all, it is because
      it discloses Mr. Lincoln's unreserved agreement with Mr. Clay in his
      opinions concerning slavery and the proper method of extinguishing it.
      They both favored gradual emancipation by the voluntary action of the
      people of the Slave States, and the transportation of the whole negro
      population to Africa as rapidly as they should be freed from service to
      their masters: it was a favorite scheme with Mr. Lincoln then, as it was
      long after he became President of the United States. "Compensated" and
      "voluntary emancipation," on the one hand, and "colonization" of the
      freedmen on the other, were essential parts of every "plan" which sprung
      out of his own individual mind. On this occasion, after quoting Mr. Clay,
      he said, "This suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the
      African race and African continent was made twenty-five years ago. Every
      succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization. May it
      indeed be realized! Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his
      hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people
      who had already served them more than four hundred years. May like
      disasters never befall us! If, as the friends of colonization hope, the
      present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means
      succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at
      the same time restoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland,
      with bright prospects for the future, and this, too, so gradually that
      neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will
      indeed be a glorious consummation. And if to such a consummation the
      efforts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed, it will be what he most
      ardently wished; and none of his labors will have been more valuable to
      his country and his kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the campaign of 1852, Judge Douglas took the stump for Pierce "in
      twenty-eight States out of the thirty-one." His first speech was at
      Richmond, Va. It was published extensively throughout the Union, and
      especially in Illinois. Mr. Lincoln felt an ardent desire to answer it,
      and, according to his own account, got the "permission" of the "Scott
      Club" of Springfield to make the speech under its auspices. It was a very
      poor effort. If it was distinguished by one quality above another, it was
      by its attempts at humor; and all those attempts were strained and
      affected, as well as very coarse. He displayed a jealous and petulant
      temper from the first sentence to the last, wholly beneath the dignity of
      the occasion and the importance of the topic. Considered as a whole, it
      may be said that none of his public performances was more unworthy of its
      really noble author than this one. The reader has doubtless observed in
      the course of this narrative, as he will in the future, that Mr. Douglas's
      great success in obtaining place and distinction was a standing offence to
      Mr. Lincoln's self-love and individual ambition. He was intensely jealous
      of him, and longed to pull him down, or outstrip him in the race for
      popular favor, which they united in considering "the chief end of man."
      Some of the first sentences of this speech before the "Scott Club" betray
      this feeling in a most unmistakable and painful manner. "This speech [that
      of Mr. Douglas at Richmond] has been published with high commendations in
      at least one of the Democratic papers in this State, and I suppose it has
      been and will be in most of the others. When I first saw it and read it, I
      was reminded of old times, <i>when Judge Douglas was not so much greater
      man than all the rest of us, as he is now</i>,&mdash;of the Harrison
      campaign twelve years ago, when I used to hear and try to answer many of
      his speeches; and believing that the Richmond speech, though marked with
      the same species of 'shirks and quirks' as the old ones, was not marked
      with any greater ability, I was seized with a strange inclination to
      attempt an answer to it; and this inclination it was that prompted me to
      seek the privilege of addressing you on this occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the progress of his remarks, Mr. Lincoln emphatically indorsed Mr.
      Douglas's great speech at Chicago in 1850, in defence of the compromise
      measures, which Mr. Lincoln pronounced the work of no party, but which,
      "for praise or blame," belonged to Whigs and Democrats alike. The rest of
      the address was devoted to a humorous critique upon Mr. Douglas's language
      in the Richmond speech, to ridicule of the campaign biographies of Pierce,
      to a description of Gens. Shields and Pierce wallowing in the ditch in the
      midst of a battle, and to a most remarkable account of a militia muster
      which might have been seen at Springfield a few years previous. Mr.
      Douglas had expressed great confidence in the sober judgment of the
      people, and at the same time had, rather inconsistently as well as
      indecently, declared that Providence had saved us from one military
      administration by the timely removal of Gen. Taylor. To this Mr. Lincoln
      alluded in his closing paragraph, which is given as a fair sample of the
      whole:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us stand by our candidate as faithfully as he has always stood by our
      country, and I much doubt if we do not perceive a slight abatement in
      Judge Douglas's confidence in Providence, as well as in the people. I
      suspect that confidence is not more firmly fixed with the judge than it
      was with the old woman whose horse ran away with her in a buggy. She said
      she 'trusted in Providence till the britchin' broke, and then she didn't
      know what on airth to do.' The chance is, the judge will see the
      'britchin' broke;' and then he can at his leisure bewail the fate of
      Locofocoism as the victim of misplaced confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th of January, 1854, Mr. Douglas, Chairman of the Committee on
      Territories, of the Senate of the United States, reported a bill to
      establish a territorial government in Nebraska. This bill contained
      nothing in relation to the Missouri Compromise, which still remained upon
      the statute-book, although the principle on which it was based had been
      violated in the Compromise legislation of 1850. A Whig Senator from
      Kentucky gave notice, that, when the Committee's bill came before the
      Senate, he would move an amendment repealing the Missouri Compromise. With
      this admonition in mind, the Committee instructed Mr. Douglas to report a
      substitute, which he did on the 23d of the same month. The substitute made
      two Territories out of Nebraska, and called one of them Kansas. It
      annulled the Missouri Compromise, forbade its application to Kansas,
      Nebraska, or any other territory, and, as amended and finally passed,
      fixed the following rules:... "It being the true intent and meaning of
      this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to
      exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to
      form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject
      only to the Constitution of the United States." Mr. Douglas had long since
      denounced his imprecations upon "the ruthless hand" that should disturb
      that ancient compact of peace between the sections; and now he put forth
      his own ingenious hand to do the deed, and to take the curse, in both of
      which he was eminently successful. Not that the Missouri Act may not have
      been repugnant to the Constitution, for no court had ever passed upon it;
      but it was enacted for a holy purpose, was venerable in age, was
      consecrated in the hearts of the people by the unsurpassed eloquence of
      the patriots of a previous generation, and having the authority of law, of
      reason, and of covenant, it had till then preserved the Union, as its
      authors designed it should; and, being in truth a sacred thing, it was not
      a proper subject for the "ruthless" interference of mere politicians, like
      those who now devoted it to destruction. If, upon a regularly heard and
      decided issue, the Supreme Court should declare it unconstitutional, the
      recision of the compact could be attributed to no party,&mdash;neither to
      slavery nor to antislavery,&mdash;and the peace of the country might still
      subsist. But its repeal by the party that did it&mdash;a coalition of
      Southern Whigs and Democrats with Northern Democrats&mdash;was evidence of
      a design to carry slavery into the region north of 36° 30'; or the
      legislation was without a purpose at all. It was the first aggression of
      the South; but be it remembered in common justice, that she was tempted to
      it by the treacherous proffers of a restless but powerful Northern leader,
      who asked no recompense but her electoral votes. In due time he opened her
      eyes to the nature of the fraud; and, if he carried through the
      Kansas-Nebraska Act to catch the votes of the South in 1856, it cost him
      no inconvenience to give it a false and startling construction to catch
      the votes of the North in 1860. In the repeal of the Compromise, the
      Northern Democrats submitted with reluctance to the dictation of Douglas
      and the South. It was the great error of the party,&mdash;the one
      disastrous error of all its history. The party succeeded in 1856 only by
      the nomination of Mr. Buchanan, who was out of the country when the
      Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed, and who was known to have opposed it. But
      the questions which grew out of it, the false and disingenuous
      construction of the act by its author, the slavery agitations in Kansas
      and throughout the country, disrupted the party at Charleston, and made
      possible Mr. Lincoln's election by a minority of the votes cast. And to
      the Whig party, whose Senators and Representatives from the South voted
      for the Douglas Bill in a body, the renewal of the slavery agitation,
      invited and insured by their action, was the signal of actual dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this date, Mr. Lincoln's views of slavery, and how they were formed,
      are as well known to the reader as they can be made known from the
      materials left behind for a history of them. It is clear that his <i>feelings</i>
      on the subject were inspired by individual cases of apparent hardship
      which had come under his observation. John Hanks, on the last trip to New
      Orleans, was struck by Lincoln's peculiarly active sympathy for the
      servile race, and insists, that, upon sight of their wrongs, "the iron
      entered his heart." In a letter to Mr. Speed, which will shortly be
      presented, Mr. Lincoln confesses to a similar experience in 1841, and
      speaks with great bitterness of the pain which the actual presence of
      chained and manacled slaves had given him. Indeed, Mr. Lincoln was not an
      ardent sympathizer with sufferings of any sort, which he did not witness
      with the eye of flesh. His compassion might be stirred deeply by an object
      present, but never by an object absent and unseen. In the former case he
      would most likely extend relief, with little inquiry into the merits of
      the case, because, as he expressed it himself, it "took a pain out of his
      own heart;" and he devoutly believed that every such act of charity or
      mercy sprung from motives purely selfish. None of his public acts, either
      before or after he became President, exhibits any special tenderness for
      the African race, or any extraordinary commiseration of their lot. On the
      contrary, he invariably, in words and deeds, postponed the interests of
      the blacks to the interests of the whites, and expressly subordinated the
      one to the other. When he was compelled, by what he deemed an overruling
      necessity, founded on both military and political considerations, to
      declare the freedom of the public enemy's slaves, he did so with avowed
      reluctance, and took pains to have it understood that his resolution was
      in no wise affected by sentiment. He never at any time favored the
      admission of negroes into the body of electors, in his own State or in the
      States of the South. He claimed that those who were incidentally liberated
      by the Federal arms were poor-spirited, lazy, and slothful; that they
      could be made soldiers only by force, and willing laborers not at all;
      that they seemed to have no interest in the cause of their own race, but
      were as docile in the service of the Rebellion as the mules that ploughed
      the fields or drew the baggage-trains; and, as a people, were useful only
      to those who were at the same time their masters and the foes of those who
      sought their good. With such views honestly formed, it is no wonder that
      he longed to see them transported to Hayti, Central America, Africa, or
      anywhere, so that they might in no event, and in no way, participate in
      the government of his country. Accordingly, he was, from the beginning, as
      earnest a colonizationist as Mr. Clay, and, even during his Presidency,
      zealously and persistently devised schemes for the deportation of the
      negroes, which the latter deemed cruel and atrocious in the extreme. He
      believed, with his rival, that this was purely a "white man's government;"
      but he would have been perfectly willing to share its blessings with the
      black man, had he not been very certain that the blessings would disappear
      when divided with such a partner. He was no Abolitionist in the popular
      sense; did not want to break over the safeguards of the Constitution to
      interfere with slavery where it had a lawful existence; but, wherever his
      power rightfully extended, he was anxious that the negro should be
      protected, just as women and children and unnaturalized men are protected,
      in life, limb, property, reputation, and every thing that nature or law
      makes sacred. But this was all: he had no notion of extending to the negro
      the <i>privilege of governing</i> him and other white men, by making him
      an elector. That was a political trust, an office to be exercised only by
      the superior race.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore as a white man, and in the interests of white men, that
      he threw himself into the struggle to keep the blacks out of the
      Territories. He did not want them there either as slaves or freemen; but
      he wanted them less as slaves than as freemen. He perceived clearly enough
      the motives of the South in repealing the Missouri Compromise. It did, in
      fact, arouse him "like a fire-bell in the night." He felt that a great
      conflict impended; and, although he had as yet no idea that it was an
      "irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces," which must
      end in making all free or all slave, he thought it was serious enough to
      demand his entire mind and heart; and he freely gave them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gillespie gives the substance of a conversation with him, which,
      judging from the context, must have taken place about this time. Prefacing
      with the remark that the slavery question was the only one "on which he
      (Mr. Lincoln) would become excited," he says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recollect meeting with him once at Shelbyville, when he remarked that
      something must be done, or slavery would overrun the whole country. He
      said there were about six hundred thousand non-slaveholding whites in
      Kentucky to about thirty-three thousand slaveholders; that, in the
      convention then recently held, it was expected that the delegates would
      represent these classes about in proportion to their respective numbers;
      but, when the convention assembled, there was not a single representative
      of the non-slaveholding class: every one was in the interest of the
      slaveholders; 'and,' said he, 'the thing is spreading like wildfire over
      the country. In a few years we will be ready to accept the institution in
      Illinois, and the whole country will adopt it.' I asked him to what he
      attributed the change that was going on in public opinion. He said he had
      put that question to a Kentuckian shortly before, who answered by saying,
      'You might have any amount of land, money in your pocket, or bank-stock,
      and, while travelling around, nobody would be any wiser; but, if you had a
      darkey trudging at your heels, everybody would see him, and know that you
      owned a slave.' 'It is the most glittering, ostentatious, and displaying
      property in the world; and now,' says he, 'if a young man goes courting,
      the only inquiry is, how many negroes he or she owns. The love for slave
      property was swallowing up every other mercenary possession. Its ownership
      betokened, not only the possession of wealth, but indicated the gentleman
      of leisure, who was above and scorned labor.' These things Mr. Lincoln
      regarded as highly seductive to the thoughtless and giddy-headed young men
      who looked upon work as vulgar and ungentlemanly. Mr. Lincoln was really
      excited, and said, with great earnestness, that this spirit ought to be
      met, and, if possible, checked; that slavery was a great and crying
      injustice, an enormous national crime, and that we could not expect to
      escape punishment for it. I asked him how he would proceed in his efforts
      to check the spread of slavery. <i>He confessed he did not see his way
      clearly. I think he made up his mind from that time that he would oppose
      slavery actively</i>. I know that Mr. Lincoln always contended that no man
      had any right other than mere brute force gave him to a slave. He used to
      say that it was singular that the courts would hold that a man never lost
      his right to his property that had been stolen from him, but that he
      instantly lost his right to himself if he was stolen. Mr. Lincoln always
      contended that the cheapest way of getting rid of slavery was for the
      nation to buy the slaves, and set them free."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill awakened Lincoln from his dream
      of security regarding the slavery question, which he hoped had been put to
      rest by the compromises of 1820 and 1850, it did the same with all
      likeminded people in the North. From that moment the Abolitionists, on the
      one hand, discerned a hope, not only of restricting slavery, but of
      ultimate emancipation; and the Southern Disunionists, on the other, who
      had lately met with numerous and signal defeats in their own section,
      perceived the means of inflaming the popular heart to the point of
      disunion. A series of agitations immediately began,&mdash;incessant,
      acrimonious, and in Kansas murderous and bloody,&mdash;which destroyed the
      Whig party at once, and continued until they severed the Democratic party
      at Charleston. All other issues were as chaff to this,&mdash;slavery or no
      slavery in the Territories,&mdash;while the discussion ranged far back of
      this practical question, and involved the much broader one, whether
      slavery possessed inherent rights under the Constitution. The Whigs South
      having voted for the repeal of the compromise, and the Whigs North against
      it, that party was practically no more. Some of its members went into the
      Know-Nothing lodges; some enlisted under the Abolition flag, and others
      drifted about and together until they formed themselves into a new
      organization, which they called Republican. It was a disbanded army; and,
      released from the authority of discipline and party tradition, a great
      part of the members engaged for a while in political operations of a very
      disreputable character. But the better class, having kept themselves
      unspotted from the pollution of Know-Nothingism, gradually but speedily
      formed the Republican party, which in due time drew into its mighty ranks
      nearly all the elements of opposition to the Democracy. Such a Whig was
      Mr. Lincoln, who lost no time in taking his ground. In Illinois the new
      party was not (in 1854) either Abolitionist, Republican, Know-Nothing,
      Whig, or Democratic, for it was composed of odds and ends of all; but
      simply the Anti-Nebraska party, of which Mr. Lincoln soon became the
      acknowledged leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from Washington, Mr. Douglas attempted to speak at Chicago; but
      he was not heard, and, being hissed and hooted by the populace of the
      city, betook himself to more complaisant audiences in the country. Early
      in October, the State Fair being in progress there, he spoke at
      Springfield. His speech was ingenious, and, on the whole, able: but he was
      on the defensive; and the consciousness of the fact, both on his own part
      and that of the audience, made him seem weaker than he really was. By
      common consent the Anti-Nebraska men put up Mr. Lincoln to reply; and he
      did reply with such power as he had never exhibited before. He was not the
      Lincoln who had spoken that tame address over Clay in 1852, or he who had
      deformed his speech before the "Scott Club" with petty jealousies and
      gross vulgarisms, but a new and greater Lincoln, the like of whom no one
      in that vast multitude had ever heard before. He felt that he was
      addressing the people on a living and vital question, not merely for the
      sake of speaking, but to produce conviction, and achieve a great practical
      result. How he succeeded in his object may be gathered from the following
      extracts from a leading editorial in "The Springfield Journal," written by
      Mr. Herndon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Anti-Nebraska speech of Mr. Lincoln was the profoundest, in our
      opinion, that he has made in his whole life. He felt upon his soul the
      truths burn which he uttered, and all present felt that he was true to his
      own soul. His feelings once or twice swelled within, and came near
      stifling utterance.... He quivered with emotion. The whole house was as
      still as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He attacked the Nebraska Bill with unusual warmth and energy; and all
      felt that a man of strength was its enemy, and that he intended to blast
      it if he could by strong and manly efforts. He was most successful, and
      the house approved the glorious triumph of truth by loud and continued
      huzzas. Women waved their white handkerchiefs in token of woman's silent
      but heartfelt assent. Douglas felt the sting: the animal within was
      roused, because he frequently interrupted Mr. Lincoln. His friends felt
      that he was crushed by Lincoln's powerful argument, manly logic, and
      illustrations from nature around us. The Nebraska Bill was shivered, and,
      like a tree of the forest, was torn and rent asunder by hot bolts of
      truth.... Mr. Lincoln exhibited Douglas in all the attitudes he could be
      placed in a friendly debate. He exhibited the bill in all its aspects to
      show its humbuggery and falsehood; and, when thus torn to rags, cut into
      slips, held up to the gaze of the vast crowd, a kind of scorn and mockery
      was visible upon the face of the crowd and upon the lips of the most
      eloquent speaker.... At the conclusion of this speech, every man, woman,
      and child felt that it was unanswerable.... He took the heart captive, and
      broke like a sun over the understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Douglas rose to reply. He was excited, angry, imperious in his tone
      and manner, and his voice loud and shrill. Shaking his forefinger at the
      Democratic malcontents with furious energy, and declaiming rather than
      debating, he occupied to little purpose the brief interval remaining until
      the adjournment for supper. Then, promising to resume his address in the
      evening, he went his way; and that audience "saw him no more." Evening
      came, but not the orator. Many fine speeches were made during the
      continuance of that fair upon the one absorbing topic,&mdash;speeches by
      the ablest men in Illinois,&mdash;Judge Trumbull, Judge Breese, Col.
      Taylor (Democratic recusants), and Stephen A. Douglas and John Calhoun
      (then Surveyor-General of Nebraska). But it is no shame to any one of
      these, that their really impressive speeches were but slightly
      appreciated, nor long remembered, beside Mr. Lincoln's splendid and
      enduring performance,&mdash;enduring in the memory of his auditors,
      although preserved upon no written or printed page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those whom the State Fair brought to Springfield for political
      purposes, were some who were neither Whigs, Democrats, Know-Nothings, nor
      yet mere Anti-Nebraska men: there were the restless leaders of the then
      insignificant Abolition faction. Chief among them was Owen Lovejoy; and
      second to him, if second to any, was William H. Herndon. But the position
      of this latter gentleman was one of singular embarrassment. According to
      himself, he was an Abolitionist "sometime before he was born," and
      hitherto he had made his "calling and election sure" by every word and act
      of a life devoted to political philanthropy and disinterested political
      labors. While the two great national parties divided the suffrages of the
      people, North and South, every thing in his eyes was "dead." He detested
      the bargains by which those parties were in the habit of composing
      sectional troubles, and sacrificing the "principle of freedom." When the
      Whig party "paid its breath to time," he looked upon its last agonies as
      but another instance of divine retribution. He had no patience with
      time-servers, and regarded with indignant contempt the "policy" which
      would postpone the natural rights of an enslaved race to the success of
      parties and politicians. He stood by at the sacrifice of the Whig party in
      Illinois with the spirit of Paul when he "held the clothes of them that
      stoned Stephen." He believed it was for the best, and hoped to see a new
      party rise in its place, great in the fervor of its faith, and animated by
      the spirit of Wilberforce, Garrison, and the Lovejoys. He was a fierce
      zealot, and gloried proudly in his title of "fanatic;" for it was his
      conviction that fanatics were at all times the salt of the earth, with
      power to save it from the blight that follows the wickedness of men. He
      believed in a God, but it was the God of nature,&mdash;the God of Socrates
      and Plato, as well as the God of Jacob. He believed in a Bible, but it was
      the open scroll of the universe; and in a religion clear and well defined,
      but it was a religion that scorned what he deemed the narrow slavery of
      verbal inspiration. Hot-blooded, impulsive, brave morally and physically,
      careless of consequences when moved by a sense of individual duty, he was
      the very man to receive into his inmost heart the precepts of Mr. Seward's
      "higher law." If he had pledged faith to slavery, no peril of life or body
      could have induced him to violate it. But he held himself no party to the
      compromises of the Constitution, nor to any law which recognized the
      justice of human bondage; and he was therefore free to act as his God and
      nature prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Herndon had determined to make an Abolitionist out of Mr. Lincoln
      when the proper time should arrive; and that time would be only when Mr.
      Lincoln could change front and "come out" without detriment to his
      personal aspirations. For, although Mr. Herndon was a zealot in the cause,
      he loved his partner too dearly to wish him to espouse it while it was
      unpopular and politically dangerous to belong to it. "I cared nothing for
      the ruin of myself," said he; "but I did not wish to see Mr. Lincoln
      sacrificed." He looked forward to a better day, and, in the mean time, was
      quite willing that Mr. Lincoln should be no more than a nominal Whig, or a
      strong Anti-Nebraska man; being quite sure, that, when the auspicious
      moment arrived, he would be able to present him to his brethren as a
      convert over whom there would surely be great joy. Still, there was a bare
      chance that he might lose him. Mr. Lincoln was beset by warm friends and
      by old coadjutors, and besought to pause in his antislavery course while
      there was yet time. Among these there was none more earnest or persuasive
      than John T. Stuart, who was but the type of a class. Tempted on the one
      side to be a Know-Nothing, and on the other side to be an Abolitionist,
      Mr. Lincoln said, as if in some doubt of his real position, "I <i>think</i>
      I am still a Whig." But Mr. Herndon was more than a match for the full
      array against him. An earnest man, instant in season and out of season, he
      spoke with the eloquence of apparent truth and of real personal love.
      Moreover, Mr. Lincoln's preconceptions inclined him to the way in which
      Mr. Herndon desired him to walk; and it is not surprising that in time he
      was, not only almost, but altogether, persuaded by a friend and partner,
      whose opportunities to reach and convince his wavering mind were, daily
      and countless. "From 1854 to 1860," says Mr. Herndon, "I kept putting in
      Lincoln's hands the speeches and sermons of Theodore Parker, the speeches
      of Phillips and Beecher. I took 'The Anti-slavery Standard' for years
      before 1856, 'The Chicago Tribune,' and 'The New York Tribune;' kept them
      in my office, kept them purposely on my table, and would read to Lincoln
      good, sharp, and solid things well put. Lincoln was a natural antislavery
      man, as I think, and yet he needed watching,&mdash;needed hope, faith,
      energy; and I think I warmed him. Lincoln and I were just the opposite one
      of another. He was cautious and practical; I was spontaneous, ideal, and
      speculative. He arrived at truths by reflection; I, by intuition; he, by
      reason; I, by my soul. He calculated; I went to toil asking no questions,
      never doubting. Lincoln had great faith in my intuitions, and I had great
      faith in his reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course such a man as we have described Mr. Herndon to be could have
      nothing but loathing and disgust for the secret oaths, the midnight
      lurking, and the proscriptive spirit of Know-Nothingism. "A number of
      gentlemen from Chicago," says he, "among them the editor of 'The Star of
      the West,' an Abolitionist paper published in Chicago, waited on me in my
      office, and asked my advice as to the policy of going into Know-Nothing
      Lodges, and ruling them for freedom. I opposed it as being wrong in
      principle, as well as a fraud on the lodges, and wished to fight it out in
      open daylight. Lincoln was opposed to Know-Nothingism, but did not say
      much in 1854 or 1855 (did afterwards). I told Lincoln what was said, and
      argued the question with him often, insisting that, as we were advocating
      <i>freedom for the slave in tendency</i> under the Kansas-Nebraska Bill,
      it was radically wrong to enslave the religious ideas and faith of men.
      The gentlemen who waited on me as before stated asked me if I thought that
      Mr. Lincoln could be trusted for freedom. I said to them, 'Can you trust
      yourselves? If you can, you can trust Lincoln forever.'"

    <p>
      With this explanation of the political views of Mr. Herndon, and his
      personal relations to Mr. Lincoln, the reader will more easily understand
      what follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This State Fair," continues Mr. Herndon, "called thousands to the city.
      We Abolitionists all assembled here, taking advantage of the fair to
      organize and disseminate our ideas. As soon as Lincoln had finished his
      speech, Lovejoy, who had been in the hall, rushed up to the stand, and
      notified the crowd that there would be a meeting there in the evening:
      subject, <i>Freedom</i>. I had been with the Abolitionists that day, and
      knew their intentions: namely, to force Lincoln with our organization, and
      to take broader and deeper and more radical views and ideas than in his
      speech, which was simply <i>Historic Kansas</i>.... He (Lincoln) had not
      then announced himself for freedom, only discussed the inexpediency of
      repealing the Missouri Compromise Line. The Abolitionists that day
      determined to make Lincoln take a stand. I determined he should <i>not at
      that time</i>, because the time had not yet come when Lincoln should show
      his hand. When Lovejoy announced the Abolition gathering in the evening, I
      rushed to Lincoln, and said, 'Lincoln, go home; take Bob and the buggy,
      and leave the county: go quickly, go right off, and never mind the order
      of your going.' Lincoln took a hint, got his horse and buggy, and did
      leave quickly, not noting the order of his going. He staid away till all
      conventions and fairs were over."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the speech against the repeal of the Compromise signally impressed all
      parties opposed to Mr. Douglas's late legislation,&mdash;Whigs,
      Abolitionists, and Democratic Free-soilers,&mdash;who agreed with perfect
      unanimity, that Mr. Lincoln should be pitted against Mr. Douglas wherever
      circumstances admitted of their meeting. As one of the evidences of this
      sentiment, Mr. William Butler drew up a paper addressed to Mr. Lincoln,
      requesting and "urging him to follow Douglas up until the election." It
      was signed by Mr. Butler, William Jayne, P. P. Eads, John Cassady, B. F.
      Irwin, and many others. Accordingly, Lincoln "followed" Douglas to Peoria,
      where the latter had an appointment, and again replied to him, in much the
      same spirit, and with the same arguments, as before. The speech was really
      a great one, almost perfectly adapted to produce conviction upon a
      doubting mind. It ought to be carefully read by every one who desires to
      know Mr. Lincoln's power as a debater, after his intellect was matured and
      ripened by years of hard experience. On the general subject of slavery and
      negroes in the Union, he spoke as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before proceeding, let me say, I think I have no prejudice against the
      Southern people: they are just what we would be in their situation. If
      slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it: if it
      did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I
      believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on
      both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and others
      would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence. We know
      that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tip-top
      Abolitionists; while some Northern men go South, and become cruel
      slave-masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin
      of slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the
      institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any
      satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. <i>I surely
      will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself.
      If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do as to the
      existing institution</i>. My first impulse would be to free all the
      existing slaves, and send them to Liberia,&mdash;to their own native land;
      but a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as
      I think there is) there may be in this, in the long run, its sudden
      execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they
      would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping
      and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times
      ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings?
      Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? <i>I think I would
      not hold</i> one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough
      to me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them
      politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of
      this; and, if mine would, we all know that those of the great mass of
      white people would not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and
      sound judgment is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it.
      A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely
      disregarded. <i>We cannot, then, make them equals</i>. It does seem to me
      that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their
      tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.
      When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them,
      not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; <i>and I would give them any
      legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in its
      stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our
      ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting
      slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the
      African slave-trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves
      <i>from</i> Africa, and that which has so long forbidden the taking them
      <i>to</i> Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle;
      and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that
      of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure. Well, I, too, go
      for saving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the
      extension of it, rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would
      consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one. But, when I go to
      Union-saving, I must believe, at least, that the means I employ have
      adaptation to the end. To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation. 'It
      hath no relish of salvation in it.' It is an aggravation, rather, of the
      only one thing which ever endangers the Union. When it came upon us, all
      was peace and quiet. The nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of
      Union, and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us.
      In the whole range of possibility, there scarcely appears to me to have
      been any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived,
      except the project of repealing the Missouri Compromise. Every inch of
      territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery
      question, and by which all parties were pledged to abide. Indeed, there
      was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire, if we
      except some extreme Northern regions, which are wholly out of the
      question. In this state of the case, the Genius of Discord himself could
      scarcely have invented a way of getting us by the ears, but by turning
      back and destroying the peace measures of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar. The people are
      to decide the question of slavery for themselves; but <i>when</i> they are
      to decide, or <i>how</i> they are to decide, or whether, when the question
      is once decided, it is to remain so, or is to be subject to an indefinite
      succession of new trials, the law does not say. Is it to be decided by the
      first dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of a
      hundred? Is it to be decided by a vote of the people, or a vote of the
      Legislature, or, indeed, on a vote of any sort? To these questions the law
      gives no answer. There is a mystery about this; for, when a member
      proposed to give the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it
      was hooted down by the friends of the bill. This fact is worth
      remembering. Some Yankees in the East are sending emigrants to Nebraska to
      exclude slavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the
      question to be decided by voting in some way or other. But the Missourians
      are awake too. They are within a stone's-throw of the contested ground.
      They hold meetings and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest
      allusion to voting is made. They resolve that slavery already exists in
      the Territory; that more shall go there; and that they, remaining in
      Missouri, will protect it, and that Abolitionists shall be hung or driven
      away. Through all this, bowie-knives and six-shooters are seen plainly
      enough, but never a glimpse of the ballot-box. And really, what is the
      result of this? Each party within having numerous and determined backers
      without, is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and
      bloodshed? Could there be a more apt invention to bring about a collision
      and violence on the slavery question than this Nebraska project is? I do
      not charge or believe that such was intended by Congress; but if they had
      literally formed a ring, and placed champions within it to fight out the
      controversy, the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is.
      And, if this fight should begin, is it likely to take a very peaceful,
      Union-saving turn? Will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real
      knell of the Union?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one in Mr. Lincoln's audience appreciated the force of this speech more
      justly than did Mr. Douglas himself. He invited the dangerous orator to a
      conference, and frankly proposed a truce. What took place between them was
      explicitly set forth by Mr. Lincoln to a little knot of his friends, in
      the office of Lincoln &amp; Herndon, about two days after the election. We
      quote the statement of B. F. Irwin, explicitly indorsed by P. L. Harrison
      and Isaac Cogdale, all of whom are already indifferently well known to the
      reader. "W. H. Herndon, myself, P. L. Harrison, and Isaac Cogdale were
      present. What Lincoln said was about this: that the day after the Peoria
      debate in 1854, Douglas came to him (Lincoln), and flattered him that he
      (Lincoln) understood the Territorial question from the organization of the
      government better than all the opposition in the Senate of the United
      States; and he did not see that he could make any thing by debating it
      with him; and then reminded him (Lincoln) of the trouble they had given
      him, and remarked that Lincoln had given him more trouble than all the
      opposition in the Senate combined; and followed up with the proposition,
      that he would go home, and speak no more during the campaign, if Lincoln
      would do the same: to which proposition Lincoln acceded." This, according
      to Mr. Irwin's view of the thing, was running Douglas "into his hole," and
      making "him holler, Enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Handbills and other advertisements announced that Judge Douglas would
      address the people of Lacon the day following the Peoria encounter; and
      the Lacon Anti-Nebraska people sent a committee to Peoria to secure Mr.
      Lincoln for a speech in reply. He readily agreed to go, and on the way
      said not a word of the late agreement to the gentleman who had him in
      charge. Judge Douglas observed the same discreet silence among his
      friends. Whether they had both agreed to go to Lacon before this agreement
      was made, or had mutually contrived this clever mode of deception, cannot
      now be determined. But, when they arrived at Lacon, Mr. Douglas said he
      was too hoarse to speak, although, "a large portion of the people of the
      county assembled to hear him." Mr. Lincoln, with unheard-of magnanimity,
      "informed his friends that he would not like to take advantage of the
      judge's indisposition, and would not address the people." His friends
      could not see the affair in the same light, and "pressed him for a
      speech;" but he persistently and unaccountably "refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas met no more during the campaign.
      Mr. Douglas did speak at least once more (at Princeton), but Mr. Lincoln
      scrupulously observed the terms of the agreement. He came home, wrote out
      his Peoria speech, and published it in seven consecutive issues of "The
      Illinois Daily Journal;" but he never spoke nor thought of speaking again.
      When his friends insisted upon having a reason for this most unexpected
      conduct, he gave the answer already quoted from Mr. Irwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election took place on the 7th of November. During his absence, Mr.
      Lincoln had been announced as a candidate for the House of Representatives
      of the Illinois Legislature. William Jayne took the responsibility of
      making him a candidate. Mrs. Lincoln, however, "saw Francis, the editor,
      and had Lincoln's name taken out." When Mr. Lincoln returned, Jayne (Mrs.
      Lincoln's old friend "Bill") went to see him. "I went to see him," says
      Jayne, "in order to get his consent to run. This was at his house. He was
      then the saddest man I ever saw,&mdash;the gloomiest. He walked up and
      down the floor, almost crying; and to all my persuasions to let his name
      stand in the paper, he said, 'No, I can't. You don't know all. I say you
      don't begin to know one-half, and that's enough.' I did, however, go and
      have his name re-instated; and there it stood. He and Logan were elected
      by about six hundred majority." Mr. Jayne had caused originally both Judge
      Logan and Mr. Lincoln to be announced, and they were both elected. But,
      after all, Mrs. Lincoln was right, and Jayne and Lincoln were both wrong.
      Mr. Lincoln was a well-known candidate for the United States Senate, in
      the place of Mr. Shields, the incumbent, who had voted for the
      Kansas-Nebraska Bill; and, when the Legislature met and showed a majority
      of Anti-Nebraska men, he thought it a necessary preliminary of his
      candidacy that he should resign his seat in the House. He did so, and Mr.
      Jayne makes the following acknowledgment: "Mr. Lincoln resigned his seat,
      finding out that the Republicans, the Anti-Nebraska men, had carried the
      Legislature. A. M. Broadwell ran as a Whig Anti-Nebraska man, and was
      badly beaten. The people of Sangamon County was down on Lincoln,&mdash;hated
      him." None can doubt that even the shame of taking a woman's advice might
      have been preferable to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Lincoln "had set his heart on going to the United States Senate."
      Counting in the Free-soil Democrats, who had revolted against Mr.
      Douglas's leadership, and been largely supported the Whigs in the late
      elections, there was now on joint ballot a clear Anti-Nebraska majority of
      two. A Senator was to be chosen to succeed Mr. Shields; and Mr. Lincoln
      had a right to expect the place. He had fairly earned the distinction, and
      nobody in the old Whig party was disposed to withhold it. But a few
      Abolitionists doubted his fidelity to their extreme views; and five
      Anti-Nebraska Senators and Representatives, who had been elected as
      Democrats, preferred to vote for a Senator with antecedents like their
      own. The latter selected Judge Trumbull as their candidate, and clung to
      him manfully through the whole struggle. They were five only in number;
      but in the situation of affairs then existing they were the sovereign
      five. They were men of conceded integrity, of good abilities in debate,
      and extraordinary political sagacity. Their names ought to be known to
      posterity, for their unfriendliness at this juncture saved Mr. Lincoln to
      the Republicans of Illinois, to be brought forward at the critical moment
      as a fresh and original candidate for the Presidency. They were Judd of
      Cook County, Palmer of Macoupin, Cook of La Salle, Baker and Allen of
      Madison. They called themselves Democrats, and, with the modesty peculiar
      to bolters, claimed to be the only "Simon-pure." "They could not act with
      the Democrats from principle, and would not act with the Whigs from
      policy;" but, holding off from the caucuses of both parties, they demanded
      that all Anti-Nebraska should come to them, or sacrifice the most
      important fruits of their late victory at the polls. But these were not
      the only enemies Mr. Lincoln could count in the body of his party. The
      Abolitionists suspected him, and were slow to come to his support. Judge
      Davis went to Springfield, and thinks he "got some" of this class "to go
      for" him; but it is probable they were "got" in another way. Mr. Lovejoy
      was a member, and required, as the condition of his support and that of
      his followers, that Mr. Lincoln should pledge himself to favor the
      exclusion of slavery from <i>all</i> the Territories of the United States.
      This was a long step in advance of any that Mr. Lincoln had previously
      taken. He was, as a matter of course, opposed to the introduction of
      slavery into the Territories north of the line of 36° 30'; but he had, up
      to this time, regarded all south of that as being honestly open to
      slavery. The villany of obliterating that line, and the necessity of its
      immediate restoration,&mdash;in short, the perfect sanctity of the
      Missouri settlement,&mdash;had formed the burden of all his speeches
      in-the preceding canvass. But these opinions by no means suited the
      Abolitionists, and they required him to change them forthwith. He thought
      it would be wise to do so, considering the peculiar circumstances of his
      case; but, before committing himself finally, he sought an understanding
      with Judge Logan. He told the judge what he was disposed to do, and said
      he would act upon the inclination, if the judge would not regard it as
      "treading upon his toes." The judge said he was opposed to the doctrine
      proposed; but, for the sake of the cause in hand, he would cheerfully risk
      his "toes." And so the Abolitionists were accommodated: Mr. Lincoln
      quietly made the pledge, and they voted for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eighth day of February, 1855, the two Houses met in convention to
      choose a Senator. On the first ballot, Mr. Shields had forty-one votes,
      and three Democratic votes were scattered. Mr. Lincoln had forty-five, Mr.
      Trumbull five, and Mr. Koerner two. On the seventh ballot, the Democrats
      left Shields, and, with two exceptions, voted for Gov. Matte-son. In
      addition to the party strength, Matteson received also the votes of two of
      the anti-Nebraska Democrats. That stout little knot, it was apparent, was
      now breaking up. For many reasons the Whigs detested Matteson most
      heartily, and dreaded nothing so much as his success. But of that there
      now appeared to be great danger; for, unless the Whigs abandoned Lincoln
      and went for Trumbull, the five Anti-Nebraska men would unite on Matteson,
      and elect him. Mr. Gillespie went to Lincoln for advice. "He said
      unhesitatingly, 'You ought to drop me, and go for Trumbull: that is the
      only way you can defeat Matteson.' Judge Logan came up about that time,
      and insisted on running Lincoln still; but the latter said, 'If you do,
      you will lose both Trumbull and myself; and I think the cause, in this
      case, is to be preferred to men.' We adopted his suggestion, and turned
      upon Trumbull, and elected him, although it grieved us to the heart to
      give up Mr. Lincoln. This, I think, shows that Mr. Lincoln was capable of
      sinking himself for the cause in which he was engaged." It was with great
      bitterness of spirit that the Whigs accepted this hard alternative. Many
      of them accused the little squad of Anti-Nebraska Democrats of "ungenerous
      and selfish" motives. One of them, "Mr. Waters of McDonough, was
      especially indignant, and utterly refused to vote for Mr. Trumbull at all.
      On the last ballot he threw away his ballot on Mr. Williams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln was very much disappointed," says Mr. Parks, a member of the
      Legislature, and one of Mr. Lincoln's special friends; "for I think, that,
      at that time, it was the height of his ambition to get into the United
      States Senate. He manifested, however, no bitterness towards Mr. Judd, or
      the other Anti-Nebraska Democrats, by whom politically he was beaten, but
      evidently thought that their motives were right. He told me several times
      afterwards, that the election of Trumbull was the best thing that could
      have happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great campaign of 1858, Mr. Douglas on various occasions insisted,
      that, in 1854, Mr. Lincoln and Judge Trumbull, being until then political
      enemies, had formed a secret agreement to abolitionize, the one the Whig,
      and the other the Democratic party; and, in order that neither might go
      unrewarded for a service so timely and patriotic, Mr. Trumbull had agreed
      on the one hand that Mr. Lincoln should have Shields's seat in the United
      States Senate (in 1855); and Mr. Lincoln had agreed, on the other, that
      Judge Trumbull should have Douglas's seat (in 1859). But Mr. Douglas
      alleged, that, when the first election (in 1854) came on, Judge Trumbull
      treated his fellow-conspirator with shameful duplicity, and cheated
      himself into the Senate just four years in advance of his appointed time;
      that, Mr. Lincoln's friends being greatly incensed thereat, Col. James H.
      Matheny, Mr. Lincoln's "friend and manager for twenty years," exposed the
      plot and the treachery; that, in order to silence and conciliate the
      injured party, Mr. Lincoln was promised the senatorial nomination in 1858,
      and thus a second time became a candidate in pursuance of a bargain more
      than half corrupt. But it is enough to say here, that Mr. Lincoln
      explicitly and emphatically denied the accusation as often as it was made,
      and bestowed upon the character of Judge Trumbull encomiums as lofty and
      as warm as he ever bestowed upon any contemporary. With the exception of
      Col. Matheny, we find none of Mr. Lincoln's peculiar friends complaining
      of Judge Trumbull; but as many of them as have spoken in the records
      before us (and they are numerous and prominent) speak of the purity,
      devotion, and excellence of Judge Trumbull in the most unreserved and
      unaffected manner. In fact and in truth, he did literally nothing to
      advance his own interest: he solicited no vote, and got none which did not
      come to him by reason of the political necessities of the time. His
      election consolidated the Anti-Nebraska party in the State, and, in the
      language of Mr. Parks, his "first encounter with Mr. Douglas in the Senate
      filled the people of Illinois with admiration for his abilities; and the
      ill feeling caused by his election gradually passed away."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Douglas had a graver charge to make against Mr. Lincoln than that
      of a simple conspiracy with Trumbull to dispose of a great office. He
      seems to have known nothing of Mr. Lincoln's secret understanding with
      Lovejoy and his associates; but he found, that, on the day previous to the
      election for Senator, Lovejoy had introduced a series of extreme
      antislavery resolutions; and with these he attempted to connect Mr.
      Lincoln, by showing, that, with two exceptions, every member who voted for
      the resolutions on the 7th of February voted also for Mr. Lincoln on the
      8th. The first of the resolutions favored the restoration of the
      prohibition of slavery north of 36° 30', and also a similar prohibition as
      to "<i>all</i> territory which now belongs to the United States, or which
      may hereafter come under their jurisdiction." The second resolution
      declared against the admission of any Slave State, no matter out of what
      Territory, or in what manner formed; and the third demanded, first, the
      unconditional repeal of the Fugitive-Slave Law, or, failing that, the
      right of <i>habeas corpus</i> and trial by jury for the person claimed as
      a slave. The first resolution was carried by a strict party vote; while
      the second and third were defeated. But Mr. Douglas asserted that Mr.
      Lincoln was committed in favor of all three, because the members that
      supported them subsequently supported him. Of all this Mr. Lincoln took no
      further notice than to say that Judge Douglas might find the Republican
      platform in the resolutions of the State Convention of that party, held at
      Bloomington in 1856. In fact, he maintained a singular reticence about the
      whole affair, probably dreading to go into it too deeply, lest his rival
      should unearth the private pledge to Lovejoy, of which Judge Logan has
      given us the history. When Judge Douglas produced a set of resolutions
      which he said had been passed by the Abolitionists at their Convention at
      Springfield, during the State Fair (the meeting alluded to by Mr.
      Herndon), and asserted that Mr. Lincoln was one of the committee that
      reported them, the latter replied with great spirit, and said what he
      could say with perfect truth,&mdash;that he was not near Springfield when
      that body met, and that his name had been used without his consent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR. LINCOLN predicted a bloody conflict in Kansas as the immediate effect
      of the repeal of the Missouri restriction. He had not long to wait for the
      fulfilment of his prophecy: it began, in fact, before he spoke; and if
      blood had not actually flowed on the plains of Kansas, occurrences were
      taking place on the Missouri border which could not avoid that result. The
      South invited the struggle by repealing a time-honored compromise, in such
      a manner as to convince the North that she no longer felt herself bound by
      any Congressional restrictions upon the institution of slavery; and that
      she intended, as far as her power would permit, to push its existence into
      all the Territories of the Union. The Northern States accepted the
      challenge promptly. The people of the Free States knew how to colonize and
      settle new Territories. The march of their westward settlements had for
      years assumed a steady tread as the population of these States augmented,
      and the facility for emigrating increased. When, therefore, the South
      threw down the barriers which had for thirty years consecrated all the
      Territories north of 36° 30' to free labor, and announced her intention of
      competing therein for the establishment of her "peculiar institution," the
      North responded by using the legitimate means at her command to throw into
      the exposed regions settlers who would organize the Territories in the
      interest of free labor. The "irrepressible conflict" was therefore opened
      in the Territories, with the people of the two sections of the country
      arrayed against each other as participants in, as well as spectators of,
      the contest. As participants, each section aided its representatives. The
      struggle opened in Kansas, and in favor of the South. During the passage
      of the bill organizing the Territory, preparations had been extensively
      made along the Missouri border, by "Blue Lodges" and "Social Bands," for
      the purpose of getting control of its Territorial government. The whole
      eastern border of the Territory was open to these marauders; and they were
      not slow to embrace the opportunity of meeting their enemies with so man y
      advantages in their favor. Public meetings were held in many of the
      frontier counties of Missouri, in which the people were not only advised
      to go over and take early possession of the Territory, but to hold
      themselves in readiness to remove all emigrants who should go there under
      the auspices of the Northern Aid Societies. It was with these "Border
      Ruffians," and some volunteers from Alabama and South Carolina, with a few
      vagabond "colonels" and "generals" from the Slave States generally, that
      the South began the struggle. Of course, the North did not look with
      complacency upon such a state of things. If the repeal of the Missouri
      Compromise startled the people of the Free States from their sense of
      security, the manner of applying "popular sovereignty," as indicated at
      its first introduction, was sufficient to arouse public sentiment to an
      unwonted degree. Kansas became at once a subject of universal interest.
      Societies were formed for throwing into her borders, with the utmost
      expedition, settlers who could be relied upon to mould her government in
      the interest of freedom. At the same time there was set in train all the
      political machinery that could be used to agitate the question, until the
      cry of "Bleeding Kansas" was heard throughout the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary in this connection to set down, in order, the raids,
      assassinations, burnings, robberies, and election frauds which followed.
      Enough if their origin and character be understood. For this present
      purpose, a brief summary only will be given of what occurred during the
      long struggle to make Kansas a Slave State; for upon the practical issues
      which arose during the contest followed the discussions between Mr.
      Lincoln and Mr. Douglas, upon the merits of which the former was carried
      into the Presidential office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Territorial governor appointed under the provisions of the
      Kansas-Nebraska Act was Andrew H. Reeder of Pennsylvania. He was appointed
      by President Pierce. He reached Kansas in the autumn of 1854, and
      proceeded to establish a Territorial Government. The first election was
      for a delegate to Congress. By the aid of the people of Missouri, it
      resulted in favor of the Democrats. The governor then ordered an election
      for a first Territorial Legislature, to be held on the 31st of March,
      1855. To this election the Missourians came in greater force than before;
      and succeeded in electing proslavery men to both Houses of the
      Legislature, with a single exception in each house. The governor, a
      proslavery man, set aside the returns in six districts, as being
      fraudulent; whereupon new elections were held, which, with one exception,
      resulted in favor of the Free-State men. These parties, however, were
      refused their seats in the Legislature; while the persons chosen at the
      previous election were accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legislature thus organized proceeded to enact the most hostile
      measures against the Free-State men. Many of these acts were promptly
      vetoed by the governor. The Legislature then petitioned the President for
      his removal. Their wishes were complied with; and Wilson G. Shannon of
      Ohio was appointed in his stead. In the mean time, the Free-State men
      entirely repudiated the Legislature, and refused to be bound by its
      enactments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the situation in Kansas when Mr. Lincoln addressed to Mr. Speed
      the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Aug. 24, 1855.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Speed,&mdash;You know what a poor correspondent I am. Ever since I
      received your very agreeable letter of the 22d of May, I have been
      intending to write you an answer to it. You suggest that in political
      action now you and I would differ. I suppose we would; not quite as much,
      however, as you may think. You know I dislike slavery; and you fully admit
      the abstract wrong of it. So far there is no cause of difference. But you
      say, that, sooner than yield your legal right to the slave,&mdash;especially
      at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested,&mdash;you would
      see the Union dissolved. I am not aware that <i>any one</i> is bidding you
      yield that right: very certainly I am not. I leave that matter entirely to
      yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the
      Constitution in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor
      creatures hunted down, and caught and carried back to their stripes and
      unrequited toils; but I bite my lip, and keep quiet. In 1841 you and I had
      together a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St.
      Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that, from Louisville to the mouth
      of the Ohio, there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together
      with irons. That sight was a continued torment to me; and I see something
      like it every time I touch the Ohio, or any other slave border. It is not
      fair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and
      continually exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather
      to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify
      their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and
      the Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and
      feeling so prompt me; and I am under no obligations to the contrary. If
      for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say, if you were
      President, you would send an army, and hang the leaders of the Missouri
      outrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself
      a Slave State, she must be admitted, or the Union must be dissolved. But
      how if she votes herself a Slave State <i>unfairly</i>,&mdash;that is, by
      the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she still be
      admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the question
      when it first becomes a practical one. In your assumption that there may
      be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you
      and I would differ about the Nebraska law. I look upon that enactment, <i>not
      as a law, but a violence</i> from the beginning. It was conceived in
      violence, is maintained in violence, and is being executed in violence. I
      say it was conceived in violence, because the destruction of the Missouri
      Compromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less than violence. It
      was passed in violence, because it could not have passed at all but for
      the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their
      constituents. It is maintained in violence, because the elections since
      clearly demand its repeal; and the demand is openly disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing that law; and
      I say the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its
      antecedents. It is being executed in the precise way which was intended
      from the first; else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or
      condemnation? Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough
      to believe that any thing like fairness was ever intended; and he has been
      bravely undeceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it will ask to be
      admitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so
      settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle of
      law ever held by any court, North or South, every negro taken to Kansas is
      free; yet, in utter disregard of this,&mdash;in the spirit of violence
      merely,&mdash;that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any
      man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is the
      substance and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang
      upon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners
      for their fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of
      the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a Territory; and when,
      by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the Union as a Slave State,
      I shall oppose it. I am very loath, in any case, to withhold my assent to
      the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith; but I do not
      admit that good faith in taking a negro to Kansas to be held in slavery is
      a probability with any man. Any man who has sense enough to be the
      controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the
      outrageous character of the whole Nebraska business. But I digress. In my
      opposition to the admission of Kansas, I shall have some company; but we
      may be beaten. If we are, I shall not, on that account, attempt to
      dissolve the Union. I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten.
      Standing as a unit among yourselves, you can, directly and indirectly,
      bribe enough of our men to carry the day, as you could on the open
      proposition to establish a monarchy. Get hold of some man in the North
      whose position and ability is such that he can make the support of your
      measure, whatever it may be, a Democratic party necessity, and the thing
      is done. Apropos of this, let me tell you an anecdote. Douglas introduced
      the Nebraska Bill in January. In February afterwards, there was a called
      session of the Illinois Legislature. Of the one hundred members composing
      the two branches of that body, about seventy were Democrats. These latter
      held a caucus, in which the Nebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally
      discussed. It was thereby discovered that just three, and no more, were in
      favor of the measure. In a day or two Douglas's orders came on to have
      resolutions passed approving the bill; and they were passed by large
      majorities!!! The truth of this is vouched for by a bolting Democratic
      member. The masses, too, Democratic as well as Whig, were even nearer
      unanimous against it; but, as soon as the party necessity of supporting it
      became apparent, the way the Democracy began to see the wisdom and justice
      of it was perfectly astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, that, if Kansas fairly votes herself a Free State, as a Christian
      you will rather rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way; and
      I do not doubt their candor. But they never vote that way. Although in a
      private letter, or conversation, you will express your preference that
      Kansas shall be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would say
      the same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any district in
      a Slave State. You think Stringfellow &amp; Co. ought to be hung; and yet,
      at the next Presidential election, you will vote for the exact type and
      representative of Stringfellow. The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a
      small, odious, and detested class among you; and yet in politics they
      dictate the course of all of you, and are as completely your masters as
      you are the master of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand.
      That is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are no
      Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted
      for the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any
      one attempting to un whig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the
      extension of slavery. I am not a Know-Nothing: that is certain. How could
      I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favor of
      degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to
      me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that"<i>all men
      are created equal.</i>" We now practically read it "all men are created
      equal, except negroes." When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read
      "all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics."
      When it comes to this, I should prefer emigrating to some country where
      they make no pretence of loving liberty,&mdash;to Russia, for instance,
      where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base, alloy of
      hypocrisy.

      A. Lincoln.

      Gov. Shannon arrived in the Territory Sept. 1,1855. On his way thither, he
      declared himself in favor of making Kansas a Slave State. He found affairs
      in a turbulent condition, which his policy by no means tended to mitigate
      or assuage. The Free-State party held a mass-meeting at Big Springs in the
      early part of September, at which they distinctly and earnestly repudiated
      the legislative government, which claimed to have been elected in March,
      as well as all laws passed by it; and they decided not to participate in
      an election for a delegate to Congress, which the Legislature had
      appointed to be held on the 1st of October following. They also held a
      Delegate Convention at Topeka, on the 19th of September, and appointed an
      Executive Committee for the Territory; and also an election for a Delegate
      to Congress, to be held on the second Tuesday in October. These two rival
      elections for a congressional delegate took place on different days; at
      the former of which, Whitfield, representing the proslavery party, was
      elected; while at the other, Gov. Reeder, representing the Free-State
      party, was chosen. On the 28d of October, the Free-State party held a
      constitutional Convention at Topeka, and formed a State constitution in
      their interest, under the provisions of which they subsequently acted, and
      also asked for admission into the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are upon this phase of the Kansas question, it may not be amiss
      to postpone the relation of some intermediate events, in order to give the
      reader the benefit of an expression of Mr. Lincoln's views, which thus far
      has found place in no printed record.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime in 1856 an association of Abolitionists was formed in Illinois to
      go to Kansas and aid the Free-State men in opposing the Government. The
      object of those engaged in this work was, in their opinion, a very
      laudable one,&mdash;no other than the defence of freedom, which they
      thought foully menaced in that far-off region. Among these gentlemen, and
      one of the most courageous and disinterested, was William H. Herndon. He
      says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln was informed of our intents by some means. Probably the idea
      of resistance was more known than I now remember. He took the first
      opportunity he could to dissuade us from our partially-formed purpose. We
      spoke of liberty, justice, and God's higher law, and invoked the spirit of
      these as our holiest inspiration. In 1856 he addressed us on this very
      subject, substantially in these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Friends, I agree with you in Providence; but I believe in the providence
      of the most men, the largest purse, and the longest cannon. You are in the
      minority,&mdash;in a sad minority; and you can't hope to succeed,
      reasoning from all human experience. You would rebel against the
      Government, and redden your hands in the blood of your countrymen. If you
      are in the minority, as you are, you can't succeed. I say again and again,
      against the Government, with a great majority of its best citizens backing
      it, and when they have the most men, the longest purse, and the biggest
      cannon, you can't succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If you have the majority, as some of you say you have, you can succeed
      with the ballot, throwing away the bullet. You can peaceably, then, redeem
      the Government, and preserve the liberties of mankind, through your votes
      and voice and moral influence. Let there be peace. In a democracy, where
      the majority rule by the ballot through the forms of law, these physical
      rebellions and bloody resistances are radically wrong, unconstitutional,
      and are treason. Better bear the ills you have than fly to those you know
      not of. Our own Declaration of Independence says, that governments long
      established, for trivial causes should not be resisted. Revolutionize
      through the ballot-box, and restore the Government once more to the
      affections and hearts of men, by making it express, as it was intended to
      do, the highest spirit of justice and liberty. Your attempt, if there be
      such, to resist the laws of Kansas by force, is criminal and wicked; and
      all your feeble attempts will be follies, and end in bringing sorrow on
      your heads, and ruin the cause you would freely die to preserve!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This little speech," continues Mr. Herndon, "is not in print. It is a
      part of a much longer one, likewise not in print. This speech squelched
      the ideas of physical resistance, and directed our energies through other
      more effective channels, which his wisdom and coolness pointed out to us.
      This little speech, so timely and well made, saved many of us from great
      follies, if not our necks from the halter. The man who uttered it is no
      more; but this little speech, I hope, shall not soon be forgotten. Mr.
      Lincoln himself, after this speech, subscribed money to the people of
      Kansas <i>under conditions</i>, which I will relate in other ways. He was
      not alone in his gifts: I signed the same paper, I think, for the same
      amount, most cheerfully; and would do it again, only doubling the sum,
      adding no conditions, only the good people's wise discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1856 it became painfully apparent to Mr. Lincoln that he must
      take a decisive stand upon the questions of the day, and become a
      Know-Nothing, a Democrat, a Republican, or an Abolitionist. Mere
      "Anti-Nebraska" would answer no longer: the members of that ephemeral
      coalition were seeking more permanent organizations. If interrogated
      concerning his position, he would probably have answered still, "I think I
      am a Whig." With the Abolition or Liberty party, he had thus far shown not
      a particle of sympathy. In 1840, 1844, 1848, and 1852, the Abolitionists,
      Liberty-men, or Free-Soilers, ran candidates of their own for the
      Presidency, and made no little noise and stir in the politics of the
      country; but they were as yet too insignificant in number to claim the
      adhesion of a practical man like Mr. Lincoln. In fact, his partner, one of
      the most earnest of them all, had not up to this time desired his
      fellowship. But now Mr. Herndon thought the hour had arrived when his hero
      should declare himself in unmistakable terms. He found, however, one
      little difficulty in the way: he was not precisely certain of his hero.
      Mr. Lincoln might go that way, and he might go the other way: his mind was
      not altogether made up; and there was no telling on which side the
      decision would fall. "He was button-holed by three ideas, and by men
      belonging to each class: first, he was urged to remain a Whig; secondly,
      he was urged to become a Know-Nothing, Say-Nothing, Do-Nothing; and,
      thirdly, he was urged to be baptized in Abolitionism: and in my
      imagination I can see Lincoln strung out three ways. At last two cords
      were snapped, he flying to Freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is the way the cords were snapped: Mr. Herndon drew up a paper to
      be signed by men of his class in politics, calling a county convention to
      elect delegates to the State convention at Bloomington. "Mr. Lincoln was
      then backward," says Mr. Herndon, "dodge-y,&mdash;so" and so. I was
      determined to make him take a stand, if he would not do it willingly,
      which he might have done, as he was naturally inclined Abolitionward.
      Lincoln was absent when the call was signed, and circulated here. I signed
      Mr. Lincoln's name without authority; had it published in "The Journal."
      John T. Stuart was keeping his eye on Lincoln, with the view of keeping
      him on his side,&mdash;the totally-dead conservative side. Mr. Stuart saw
      the published call, and grew mad; rushed into my office, seemed mad,
      horrified, and said to me, 'Sir, did Mr. Lincoln sign that Abolition call
      which is published this morning?' I answered, 4 Mr. Lincoln did not sign
      that call.'&mdash;'Did Lincoln authorize you to sign it?' said Mr. Stuart.
      'No: he never authorized me to sign it.'&mdash;'Then do you know that you
      have ruined Mr. Lincoln?'&mdash;'I did not know that I had ruined Mr.
      Lincoln; did not intend to do so; thought he was a made man by it; that
      the time had come when conservatism was a crime and a blunder.'&mdash;'You,
      then, take the responsibility of your acts; do you?'&mdash;'I do, most
      emphatically.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, I instantly sat down and wrote to Mr. Lincoln, who was then in
      Pekin or Tremont,&mdash;possibly at court. He received my letter, and
      instantly replied, either by letter or telegraph,&mdash;most likely by
      letter,&mdash;that he adopted <i>in toto</i> what I had done, and promised
      to meet the radicals&mdash;Lovejoy, and suchlike men&mdash;among us."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bloomington Lincoln was the great figure. Beside him all the rest&mdash;even
      the oldest in the faith and the strongest in the work&mdash;were small.
      Yet he was universally regarded as a recent convert, although the most
      important one that could be made in the State of Illinois. "We met at
      Bloomington; and it was there," says Mr. Herndon in one of his lectures,
      "that Mr. Lincoln was baptized, and joined our church. He made a speech to
      us. I have heard or read all Mr. Lincoln's great speeches; and I give it
      as my opinion, on my best judgment, that the Bloomington speech was the
      grand effort of his life. Heretofore, and up to this moment, he had simply
      argued the slavery question on grounds of policy,&mdash;on what are called
      the statesman's grounds,&mdash;never reaching the question of the radical
      and the eternal right. Now he was newly baptized and freshly born: he had
      the fervor of a new convert; the smothered flame broke out; enthusiasm
      unusual to him blazed up; his eyes were aglow with an inspiration; he felt
      justice; his heart was alive to the right; his sympathies, remarkably deep
      for him, burst forth, and he stood before the throne of the eternal Right,
      in presence of his God, and then and there unburdened his penitential and
      fired soul. This speech was fresh, new, genuine, odd, original; filled
      with fervor not unmixed with a divine enthusiasm; his head breathing out
      through his tender heart its truths, its sense of right, and its feeling
      of the good and for the good. This speech was full of fire and energy and
      force: it was logic; it was pathos; it was enthusiasm; it was justice,
      equity, truth, right, and the good, set ablaze by the divine fires of a
      soul maddened by the wrong; it was hard, heavy, knotty, gnarly, edged, and
      heated. I attempted for about fifteen minutes, as was usual with me then,
      to take notes; but at the end of that time I threw pen and paper to the
      dogs, and lived only in the inspiration of the hour. If Mr. Lincoln was
      six feet four inches high usually, <i>at Bloomington</i> he was seven
      feet, and inspired at that. From that day to the day of his death, he
      stood firm on the right. He felt his great cross, had his great idea,
      nursed it, kept it, taught it to others, and in his fidelity bore witness
      of it to his death, and finally sealed it with his precious blood."

    <p>
      If any thing in the foregoing description by Mr. Herndon seems extravagant
      to the reader, something must be pardoned to the spirit of a patient
      friend and an impatient teacher, who saw in this scene the first fruits of
      his careful husbandry, and the end of his long vigil. He appears to have
      participated even then in the belief which Mr. Lincoln himself avowed,&mdash;that
      the latter was designed by the Dispenser of all things to occupy a great
      place in the world's history; and he felt that that day's doings had fixed
      his political character forever. The Bloomington Convention was called
      "Republican," and the Republican party of Illinois was there formed: but
      the most noted Abolitionists were in it, the spirit of the Lovejoys was
      present; and Mr. Herndon had a right to say, that, if Mr. Lincoln was not
      an Abolitionist, he was tending "Abolition-ward" so surely that no doubt
      could be entertained of his ultimate destination. But, after all, the
      resolutions of the convention were very "moderate." They merely denounced
      the administration for its course regarding Kansas, stigmatized the repeal
      of the Missouri Compromise as an act of bad faith, and opposed "the
      extension of slavery into Territories heretofore free." It was surely not
      because Mr. Lincoln was present, and aiding at the passage of such
      resolutions, that Mr. Herndon and others thereafter regarded him as a
      "newborn" Abolitionist. It must have been the general warmth of his speech
      against the South,&mdash;his manifest detestation of slaveholders and
      slaveholding, as exhibited in his words,&mdash;which led them to believe
      that his feelings at least, if not his opinions, were similar to theirs.
      But the reader will see, nevertheless, as we get along in our history,
      that the Bloomington resolutions were the actual standard of Mr. Lincoln's
      views; that he continued to express his determination to maintain the
      rights of the Slave States under the Constitution, and to make
      conspicuously plain his abhorrence of negro suffrage and negro equality.
      He certainly disliked the Southern politicians very much; but even that
      sentiment, growing daily more fierce and ominous in the masses of the new
      party, was in his case counterbalanced by his prejudices or his caution,
      and he never saw the day when he would willingly have clothed the negroes
      with political privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the conservative character of the resolutions, the
      proceedings of the Bloomington Convention were alarming to a portion of
      the community, and seem to have found little favor with the people of
      Springfield. About five days after its adjournment, Herndon and Lincoln
      bethought them of holding a ratification meeting. Mr. Herndon got out huge
      posters, announcing the event, and employed a band of musicians to parade
      the streets and "drum up a crowd." As the hour of meeting drew near, he
      "lit up the Court House with many blazes," rung the bells, and blew a
      horn. At seven o'clock the meeting should have been called to order, but
      it turned out to be extremely slim. There was nobody present, with all
      those brilliant lights, but A. Lincoln, W. H. Herndon, and John Pain.
      "When Lincoln came into the courtroom," says the bill-poster and
      horn-blower of this great demonstration, "he came with a sadness and a
      sense of the ludicrous on his face. He walked to the stand, mounted it in
      a kind of mockery,&mdash;mirth and sadness all combined,&mdash;and said,
      'Gentlemen, this meeting is larger than I <i>knew</i> it would be. I knew
      that Herndon and myself would come, but I did not know that any one else
      would be here; and yet another has come,&mdash;you, John Pain. These are
      sad times, and seem out of joint. All seems dead, dead, dead: but the age
      is not yet dead; it liveth as sure as our Maker liveth. Under all this
      seeming want of life and motion, the world does move nevertheless. Be
      hopeful. And now let us adjourn, and appeal to the people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This speech is in substance just as he delivered it, and substantially in
      the same sad but determined spirit; and so we did adjourn, did go out, and
      did witness the fact that 'the world was not dead.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bloomington Convention sent delegates to the general Republican
      Convention, which was to be held at Philadelphia in June. That body was to
      nominate candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, and high hopes
      were entertained of their success. But much remained to be done before
      such a revolution in sentiment could be expected. The American or
      Know-Nothing party&mdash;corrupt, hideous, and delusive, but still
      powerful&mdash;had adopted the old Whig platform on the several slavery
      questions, and planted itself decisively against the agitations of the
      Anti-Nebraska men and the Republicans. A "National Council" had taken this
      position for it the year previous, in terms beside which the resolutions
      of the Whigs and Democrats in 1852 were mild and inexpressive. Something,
      therefore, must be done to get this great organization out of the way, or
      to put its machinery under "Republican" control. We have seen a party of
      gentlemen from Chicago proposing to go into the lodges, and "rule them for
      freedom." Mr. Herndon and Mr. Lincoln rejected the plot with lofty
      indignation; but a section of the Free-Soil politicians were by no means
      so fastidious. They were for the most part bad, insincere, trading men,
      with whom the profession of principles of any kind was merely a convenient
      disguise, and who could be attached to no party, except from motives of
      self-interest. As yet, they were not quite certain whether it were
      possible to raise more hatred in the Northern mind against foreigners and
      Catholics than against slaveholders; and they prudently determined to be
      in a situation to try either. Accordingly, they went into the lodges, took
      the oaths, swore to stand by the platform of the "National Council" of
      1855, and were perfectly ready to do that, or to betray the organization
      to the Republicans, as the prospect seemed good or bad. Believing the
      latter scheme to be the best, upon deliberation, they carried it out as
      far as in them lay, and then told the old, grim, honest, antislavery men,
      with whom they again sought association, that they had joined the
      Know-Nothings, and sworn irrevocable oaths to proscribe foreigners and
      Catholics, solely that they might rule the order "for freedom;" and, the
      Republicans standing in much need of aid just then, the excuse was
      considered very good. But it was too shameless a business for Lincoln and
      Herndon; and they most righteously despised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February, 1856, the Republicans held what Mr. Greeley styles their
      "first National. Convention," at Pittsburg; but they made no nominations
      there. At the same time, a Know-Nothing American "National Council" was
      sitting at Philadelphia (to be followed by a nominating convention); and
      the Republicans at Pittsburg had not adjourned before they got news by
      telegraph, that the patriots who had entered the lodges on false pretences
      were achieving a great success: the American party was disintegrating, and
      a great section of it falling away to the Republicans. A most wonderful
      political feat had been performed, and the way was now apparently clear
      for a union of the all-formidable anti-Democratic elements in the
      Presidential canvass.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 17th of June the National Republican Convention met at
      Philadelphia, and nominated John C. Fremont for President, and William L.
      Dayton for Vice-President. Mr. Williams, Chairman of the Illinois
      Delegation, presented to the convention the name of Abraham Lincoln for
      the latter office; and it was received with great enthusiasm by some of
      the Western delegates. He received, however, but 110 votes, against 259
      for Mr. Dayton, and 180 scattered; and Mr. Dayton was immediately
      thereafter unanimously declared the nominee.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this convention was sitting, Mr. Lincoln was attending court at
      Urbana, in Champaign County. When the news reached that place that Mr.
      Dayton had been nominated, and "Lincoln had received 110 votes," some of
      the lawyers insisted that the latter must have been "our [their] Lincoln;"
      but he said, "No, it could not be: it must have been the <i>great</i>
      Lincoln from Massachusetts." He utterly refused to believe in the reality
      of this unexpected distinction until he saw the proceedings in full. He
      was just then in one of his melancholy moods, his spirits depressed, and
      his heart suffering the miseries of a morbid mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an indorsement of the "self-evident truths" and "inalienable rights"
      of the Declaration of Independence, the Republican Convention adopted the
      following as the practical and essential features of its platform:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved,... That we deny the authority of Congress, of a territorial
      Legislature, of any individual, or association of individuals, to give
      legal existence to slavery in any Territory of the United States while the
      present Constitution shall be maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That the Constitution confers upon Congress sovereign power
      over the Territories of the United States for their government; and that,
      in the exercise of this power, it is both the right and the duty of
      Congress to prohibit in the Territories those twin relics of barbarism,&mdash;polygamy
      and slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Democratic Convention had already placed in nomination
      Buchanan and Breckenridge. Their platform denounced as sectional the
      principles and purposes of their opponents; re-affirmed "the principles
      contained in the organic laws establishing the Territories of Kansas and
      Nebraska, as embodying the only sound and safe solution of the slavery
      question," and declared further,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "That by the uniform application of Democratic principles to the
      organization of Territories and the admission of new States, with or
      without slavery as they may elect, the equal rights of all the States will
      be preserved intact, the original compacts of the Constitution maintained
      inviolate, and the perpetuity and expansion of the Union insured to its
      utmost capacity of embracing, in peace and harmony, every future American
      State that may be constituted or annexed with a republican form of
      government."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was again a candidate for the office of Presidential elector,
      and made a thorough and energetic canvass. Some of his speeches were very
      striking; and probably no man in the country discussed the main questions
      in that campaign&mdash;Kansas, and slavery in the Territories&mdash;in a
      manner more original and persuasive. From first to last, he scouted the
      intimation that the election of Fremont would justify a dissolution of the
      Union, or that it could possibly become even the occasion of a
      dissolution. In his eyes, the apprehensions of disunion were a "humbug;"
      the threat of it mere bluster, and the fear of it silly timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heat of the canvass, Mr. Lincoln wrote the following perfectly
      characteristic letter,&mdash;marked "Confidential:"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Sept. 8, 1856.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrison Maltby, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;I understand you are a Fillmore man. Let me prove to you
      that every vote withheld from Fremont and given to Fillmore in this State
      actually lessens Fillmore's chance of being President.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose Buchanan gets all the Slave States and Pennsylvania, and any other
      one State besides; then he is elected, no matter who gets all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose Fillmore gets the two Slave States of Maryland and Kentucky;
      then Buchanan is not elected: Fillmore goes into the House of
      Representatives, and may be made President by a compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose, again, Fillmore's friends throw away a few thousand votes on
      him in Indiana and Illinois: it will inevitably give these States to
      Buchanan, which will more than compensate him for the loss of Maryland and
      Kentucky; will elect him, and leave Fillmore no chance in the H. R., or
      out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is as plain as adding up the weights of three small hogs. As Mr.
      Fillmore has no possible chance to carry Illinois for himself, it is
      plainly to his interest to let Fremont take it, and thus keep it out of
      the hands of Buchanan. Be not deceived. Buchanan is the hard horse to beat
      in this race. Let him have Illinois, and nothing can beat him; and he will
      get Illinois if men persist in throwing away votes upon Mr. Fillmore. Does
      some one persuade you that Mr. Fillmore can carry Illinois? Nonsense!
      There are over seventy newspapers in Illinois opposing Buchanan, only
      three or four of which support Mr. Fillmore, all the rest going for
      Fremont. Are not these newspapers a fair index of the proportion of the
      votes? If not, tell me why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, of these three or four Fillmore newspapers, two, at least, are
      supported in part by the Buchanan men, as I understand. Do not they know
      where the shoe pinches? They know the Fillmore movement helps them, and
      therefore they help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do think these things over, and then act according to your judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours very truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Confidential.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was discovered by the Buchanan men, printed in their
      newspapers, and pronounced, as its author anticipated, "a mean trick." It
      was a dangerous document to them, and was calculated to undermine the very
      citadel of their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was still in imperfect fellowship&mdash;if, indeed, in any
      fellowship at all&mdash;with the extreme Abolitionists. He had met with
      Lovejoy and his followers at Bloomington, and was apparently co-operating
      with them for the same party purposes; but the intensity of his opposition
      to their radical views is intimated very strongly in this letter to Mr.
      Whitney:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SprinGfield, July 9, 1856.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Whitney,&mdash;I now expect to go to Chicago on the 15th, and I
      probably shall remain there or thereabout for about two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy
      nominated; but, after much anxious reflection, I really believe it is best
      to let it stand. This, of course, I wish to be confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamon did get your deeds. I went with him to the office, got them, and put
      them in his hands myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours very truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1857, Judge Douglas made a speech at Springfield, in which he
      attempted to vindicate the wisdom and fairness of the law under which the
      people of Kansas were about to choose delegates to a convention to be held
      at Lecompton to frame a State constitution. He declared with emphasis,
      that, if the Free-State party refused to vote at this election, they alone
      would be blamable for the proslavery constitution which might be formed.
      The Free-State men professed to have a vast majority,&mdash;"three-fourths,"
      "four-fifths," "nine-tenths," of the voters of Kansas. If these wilfully
      staid away from the polls, and allowed the minority to choose the
      delegates and make the constitution, Mr. Douglas thought they ought to
      abide the result, and not oppose the constitution adopted. Mr. Douglas's
      speech indicated clearly that he himself would countenance no opposition
      to the forthcoming Lecompton Convention, and that he would hold the
      Republican politicians responsible if the result failed to be satisfactory
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Douglas seldom spoke in that region without provoking a reply from
      his constant and vigilant antagonist. Mr. Lincoln heard this speech with a
      critical ear, and then, waiting only for a printed report of it, prepared
      a reply to be delivered a few weeks later. The speeches were neither of
      them of much consequence, except for the fact that Judge Douglas seemed to
      have plainly committed himself in advance to the support of the Lecompton
      Constitution. Mr. Lincoln took that much for granted; and, arguing from
      sundry indications that the election would be fraudulently conducted, he
      insisted that Mr. Douglas himself, as the author of the Kansas-Nebraska
      Bill, and the inventor of "popular sovereignty," had made this "outrage"
      possible. He did not believe there were any "Free-State Democrats" in
      Kansas to make it a Free State without the aid of the Republicans, whom he
      held to be a vast majority of the population. The latter, he contended,
      were not all registered; and, because all were not registered, he thought
      none ought to vote. But Mr. Lincoln advised no bloodshed, no civil war, no
      roadside assassinations. Even if an incomplete registry might justify a
      majority of the people in an obstinate refusal to participate in the
      regulation of their own affairs, it certainly would not justify them in
      taking up arms to oppose all government in the Territory; and Mr. Lincoln
      did not say so. We have seen already how, in the "little speech" reported
      by Mr. Herndon, he deprecated "all physical rebellions" in this country,
      and applied his views to this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln also discussed the Dred-Scott Decision at some length; and,
      while doing so, disclosed his firm belief, that, in some respects, such as
      "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," the negroes were made by
      the Declaration of Independence the equals of white men. But it did not
      follow from this that he was in favor of political or social equality with
      them. "There is," said he, "a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all
      the white people to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the
      white and black races; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief
      hope upon the chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this
      disgust to himself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the
      odium of that idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through
      the storm. He therefore clings to his hope, as a drowning man to the last
      plank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the
      Dred-Scott Decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the
      Declaration of Independence includes all men,&mdash;black as well as
      white; and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and
      proceeds to argue gravely, that all who contend it does, do so only
      because they want to vote, eat, sleep, and marry with negroes. Now, I
      protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes, that, because I do
      not want a black woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a
      wife. I need not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some
      respects, she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat
      the bread she earns with her own hands, without asking leave of any one
      else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others."
    </p>
    <p>
      These speeches were delivered, the one early and the other late, in the
      month of June: they present strongly, yet guardedly, the important issues
      which were to engage Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas in the famous campaign of
      1858, and leave us no choice but to look into Kansas, and observe what had
      taken place and what was happening there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violence still (June, 1857) prevailed throughout the Territory. The
      administration of President Pierce committed itself at the first in
      support of the proslavery party. It acknowledged the Legislature as the
      only legal government in the Territory, and gave it military assistance to
      enforce its enactments. Gov. Shannon, having by his course only served to
      increase the hostility between the parties, was recalled, and John W.
      Geary of Pennsylvania was appointed his successor. Gov. Geary, while
      adopting the policy of the administration, so far as recognizing the
      Legislative party as the only legally organized government, was yet
      disposed to see, that, so far as the two parties could be got to act
      together, each should be fairly protected. This policy, however, soon
      brought him into collision with some of the proslavery leaders in the
      Territory; and, not being sustained by Mr. Buchanan's administration,
      which had in the mean time succeeded the administration of President
      Pierce, he resigned his office. Hon. Robert J. Walker of Mississippi was
      appointed his successor, with Hon. F. P. Stanton of Tennessee as
      secretary. Both were strong Democrats; and both were earnest advocates of
      the policy of the administration, as expressed in the recent presidential
      canvass, and in Mr. Buchanan's inaugural Message,&mdash;the absolute
      freedom of the people of the Territories to form such governments as they
      saw fit, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Gov. Walker and
      his secretary earnestly set themselves to work to carry out this policy.
      The governor, in various addresses to the people of the Territory, assured
      all parties that he would protect them in the free expression of their
      wishes in the election for a new Territorial legislature; and he besought
      the Free-State men to give up their separate Territorial organization,
      under which they had already applied for admission into the Union, and by
      virtue of which they claimed still to have an equitable legal existence.
      The governor was so earnest in his policy, and so fair-minded in his
      purposes, that he soon drew upon himself the opposition of the proslavery
      party of the Territory, now in a small minority, as well as the enmity of
      that party in the States. He assured the people they should have a fair
      election for the new Legislature to be chosen in October (1857), and which
      would come into power in January following. The people took him at his
      word; and he kept it. Enormous frauds were discovered in two districts,
      which were promptly set aside. The triumph of the Free-State party was
      complete: they elected a legislature in their interest by a handsome
      majority. And now began another phase of the struggle. The policy of the
      Governor and the Secretary was repudiated at Washington: the former
      resigned, and the latter was removed. Meanwhile, a convention held under
      the auspices of the old Legislature had formed a new constitution, known
      as the Lecompton Constitution, which the old Legislature proposed to
      submit to the people for ratification on the 21st of December. The manner
      of submitting it was singular, to say the least. The people were required
      to vote either for the constitution with slavery, or the constitution
      without slavery. As without slavery the constitution was in some of its
      provisions as objectionable as if it upheld slavery, the Free-State men
      refused to participate in its ratification. The vote on its submission,
      therefore, stood 4,206 for the constitution with slavery, and 567 without
      slavery; and it was this constitution, thus submitted and thus adopted,
      that Mr. Buchanan submitted to Congress on the 2d of February, 1858, as
      the free expression of the wishes of the people of Kansas; and its support
      was at once made an administration measure. Meantime the new Legislature
      elected by the people of the Territory in October submitted this same
      Lecompton Constitution to the people again, and in this manner: votes to
      be given for the constitution with slavery and without slavery, and also
      against the constitution entirely. The latter manner prevailed; the vote
      against the constitution in any form being over ten thousand. Thus the
      proslavery party in the Territory was overthrown. Under the auspices of
      the new Free-State Legislature, a constitutional convention was held at
      Wyandotte, in March, 1859. A Free-State constitution was adopted, under
      which Kansas was subsequently admitted into the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving this Kansas question, there is one phase of the closing
      part of the struggle which it is worth while to note, particularly as it
      has a direct bearing upon the fortunes of Judge Douglas, and indirectly to
      the success of Mr. Lincoln. Douglas always insisted that his plan of
      "popular sovereignty" would give to the people of the Territories the
      utmost freedom in the formation of their local governments. When Mr.
      Buchanan attempted to uphold the Lecompton Constitution as being the free
      choice of the people of Kansas, Judge Douglas at once took issue with the
      administration on this question, and the Democratic party was split in
      twain. Up to the time of the vote of the people of the Territory on the
      constitution, Douglas had been an unswerving supporter of the
      administration policy in Kansas. His speech at Springfield, in the June
      previous, could not be misunderstood. He held all the proceedings which
      led to the Lecompton issue to be in strict accordance, not only with the
      letter, but the spirit, of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and with the faith of
      the Democratic party as expounded by himself. But a few weeks later it
      became manifest that his opinions had undergone a change. Ominous rumors
      of a breach with the administration began to circulate among his friends.
      It was alleged at length that Mr. Douglas's delicate sense of justice had
      been shocked by the unfairness of certain elections in Kansas: it was even
      intimated that he, too, considered the Lecompton affair an "outrage" upon
      the sovereign people of Kansas, and that he would speedily join the
      Republicans&mdash;the special objects of his indignation in the June
      speech&mdash;in denouncing and defeating it. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill had
      borne its appropriate fruits,&mdash;the fruits all along predicted by Mr.
      Lincoln,&mdash;and Mr. Douglas commended them to anybody's eating but his
      own. His desertion was sudden and astonishing; but there was method in it,
      and a reason for it. The next year Illinois was to choose a senator to
      fill the vacancy created by the expiration of his own term; and the choice
      lay between the author of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill and its most
      conspicuous opponent in that State. The newspapers were not yet done
      publishing Mr. Lincoln's speech, in which occurred the following
      paragraph:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three years and a half ago Judge Douglas brought forward his famous
      Nebraska Bill. The country was at once in a blaze. He scorned all
      opposition, and carried it through Congress. Since then he has seen
      himself superseded in a Presidential nomination by one indorsing the
      general doctrine of his measure, but at the same time standing clear of
      the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross' breach of national
      faith; and he has seen the successful rival constitutionally elected, not
      by the strength of friends, but by the division of his adversaries, being
      in a popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes. He has seen
      his chief aids in his own State, Shields and Richardson, politically
      speaking, successively tried, convicted, and executed for an offence not
      their own, but his. And now he sees his own case standing next on the
      docket for trial."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      ALTHOUGH primarily responsible for all that had taken place in Kansas, Mr.
      Douglas appeared to be suddenly animated by a new and burning zeal in
      behalf of the Free-State party in the Territory. It struck him very
      forcibly, just when he needed most to be struck by a new idea, that the
      Lecompton Constitution was not "the act and deed of the people of Kansas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Mr. Douglas took his stand against Lecompton at the first
      note of the long conflict in Congress. We shall make no analysis of the
      debates, nor set out the votes of senators and representatives which
      marked the intervals of that fierce struggle between sections, parties,
      and factions which followed. It is enough to say here, that Mr. Douglas
      was found speaking and voting with the Republicans upon every phase of the
      question. He had but one or two followers in the Senate, and a mere
      handful in the House; yet these were faithful to his lead until a final
      conference committee and the English Bill afforded an opportunity for some
      of them to escape. For himself he scorned all compromises, voted against
      the English Bill, and returned to Illinois to ask the votes of the people
      upon a winter's record wholly and consistently anti-Democratic. The fact
      is mentioned, not to obscure the fame of the statesman, nor to impugn the
      honesty of the politician, but because it had an important influence upon
      the canvass of the ensuing summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter Mr. Douglas held frequent consultations with the leaders
      of the Republican party. Their meetings were secret, and for that reason
      the more significant. By this means, harmony of action was secured for the
      present, and something provided for the future. Mr. Douglas covertly
      announced himself as a convert to the Republicans, declared his
      uncompromising enmity to "the slave power," and said that, however he
      might be distrusted then, he would be seen "fighting their battles in
      1860;" but for the time he thought it wise to conceal his ultimate
      intentions. He could manage the Democracy more effectually by remaining
      with them until better opportunities should occur. "He insisted that he
      would never be driven from the party, but would remain in it until he
      exposed the administration and the Disunionists; and, when he went out, he
      would go of his own accord. He was in the habit of remarking, that it was
      policy for him to remain in the party, in order to hold certain of the
      rank-and-file; so that, if he went over from the Democracy to any other
      party, he would be able to take the crowd along with him; and, when he got
      them all over, he would cut down the bridges, and sink the boats." When
      asked if he knew precisely where his present course was taking him, he
      answered repeatedly, "I do; and I have checked all my baggage, and taken a
      through ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a proselyte not to be despised: his weight might be sufficient to
      turn the scale in the Presidential election. The Republicans were
      naturally pleased with his protestations of friendship, and more than
      pleased with his proffers of active service; but he was not content with
      this alone. He contrived to convince many of his late opponents that the
      Kansas-Nebraska Bill itself was actually conceived in the interests of
      antislavery, and that the device was the most cunning of political tricks,
      intended to give back to "freedom" all the vast expanse of territory which
      the Missouri line had dedicated forever to slavery. "Mr. Douglas's plan
      for destroying the Missouri line," said one Republican, "and thereby
      opening the way for the march of freedom beyond the limits forever
      prohibited by that line, and the opening up of Free States in territory
      which it was conceded belonged to the Slave States, and its march
      westward, embracing the whole line of the Pacific from the British
      possessions to Mexico, struck me as the most magnificent scheme ever
      conceived by the human mind. This character of conversation, so frequently
      employed by Mr. Douglas with those with whom he talked, made the deepest
      impression upon their minds, enlisted them in his behalf, and changed, in
      almost every instance, their opinion of the man." In support of this view,
      Mr. Douglas could point to Kansas, where the battle under his bill was
      being fought out. The Free-State men had, perhaps from the very beginning,
      been in a majority, and could take possession of the Territory or the new
      State, as the case might be, whenever they could secure a fair vote. The
      laboring classes of, the North were the natural settlers of the western
      Territories. If these failed in numbers, the enormous and increasing
      European immigration was at their back; and, if both together failed, the
      churches, aid societies, and antislavery organizations were at hand to
      raise, arm, and equip great bodies of emigrants, as they would regular
      forces for a public purpose. The South had no such facilities: its social,
      political, and material conditions made a sudden exodus of its voting
      population to new countries a thing impossible. It might send here a man
      with a few negroes, and there another. It might insist vehemently upon its
      supposed rights in the common Territories, and be ready to fight for them;
      but it could never cover the surface of those Territories with cosey
      farmsteads, or crowd them with intelligent and muscular white men; and yet
      these last would inevitably give political character to the rising
      communities. Such clearly were to be the results of "popular sovereignty,"
      as Mr. Douglas had up to that time maintained it under the Nebraska Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It signified the right of the people of a Territory "to form and regulate
      their domestic institutions in their own way" when, and not before, they
      came to frame a State constitution. The Missouri line, on the contrary,
      had been a sort of convention, which, by common consent, gave all north of
      it to freedom, and all south of it to slavery. But popular sovereignty
      disregarded all previous compacts, all ordinances, and all laws. With this
      doctrine in practice, the North were sure to be victors in every serious
      contest. But when Mr. Douglas changed ground again, and popular
      sovereignty became squatter sovereignty, he had reason to boast himself
      the most efficient, although the wiliest and coolest, antislavery agitator
      on the continent. The new doctrine implied the right of a handful of
      settlers to determine the slavery question in their first Legislature. It
      made no difference whether they did this by direct or "unfriendly
      legislation:" the result was the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Popular sovereignty! popular sovereignty!" said Mr. Lincoln. "Let us for
      a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty. What is
      popular sovereignty? We recollect, that, in an early period in the history
      of this struggle, there was another name for the same thing,&mdash;<i>squatter
      sovereignty</i>. It was not exactly popular sovereignty,&mdash;squatter
      sovereignty. What do these terms mean? What do those terms mean when used
      now? And vast credit is taken by our friend, the Judge, in regard to his
      support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have been, and
      all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of
      popular sovereignty. What is it? Why, it is the sovereignty of the people!
      What was squatter sovereignty? I suppose, if it had any significance at
      all, it was the right of the people to govern themselves, to be sovereign
      in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their
      own, while they had squatted on a territory that did not belong to them;
      in the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit it, when it
      belongs to the nation. Such right to govern themselves was called
      'squatter sovereignty.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, and on another occasion, but still before Mr. Douglas had
      substituted "squatter" for "popular" sovereignty,&mdash;a feat which was
      not performed until September, 1859,&mdash;Mr. Lincoln said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose almost every one knows, that in this controversy, whatever has
      been said has had reference to negro slavery. We have not been in a
      controversy about the right of the people to govern themselves in the
      ordinary matters of domestic concern in the States and Territories. Mr.
      Buchanan, in one of his late messages (I think when he sent up the
      Lecompton Constitution), urged that the main point to which the public
      attention had been directed was not in regard to the great variety of
      small domestic matters, but it was directed to negro slavery; and he
      asserts, that, if the people had had a fair chance to vote on that
      question, there was no reasonable ground of objection in regard to minor
      questions. Now, while I think that the people had not had given them, or
      offered them, a fair chance upon that slavery question, still, if there
      had been a fair submission to a vote upon that main question, the
      President's proposition would have been true to the uttermost. Hence, when
      hereafter I speak of popular sovereignty, I wish to be understood as
      applying what I say to the question of slavery only, not to other minor
      domestic matters of a Territory or a State.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Judge Douglas, when he says that several of the past years of his
      life have been devoted to the question of popular sovereignty, and that
      all the remainder of his life shall be devoted to it,&mdash;does he mean
      to say, that he has been devoting his life to securing to the people of
      the Territories the right to exclude slavery from the Territories? If he
      means so to say, he means to deceive; because he and every one knows that
      the decision of the Supreme Court, which he approves, and makes an
      especial ground of attack upon me for disapproving, forbids the people of
      a Territory to exclude slavery. This covers the whole ground, from the
      settlement of a Territory till it reaches the degree of maturity entitling
      it to form a State constitution. So far as all that ground is concerned,
      the judge is not sustaining popular sovereignty, but absolutely opposing
      it. He sustains the decision which declares that the popular will of the
      Territories has no constitutional power to exclude slavery during their
      territorial existence. This being so, the period of time from the first
      settlement of a territory till it reaches the point of forming a State
      constitution is not the thing that the Judge has fought for, or is
      fighting for; but, on the contrary, he has fought for, and is fighting
      for, the thing that annihilates and crushes out that same popular
      sovereignty."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable, that, in the numerous private conferences held by Mr.
      Douglas with Republican leaders in the winter of 1857-8, he managed to
      convince them that it was, after all, not popular sovereignty, but
      squatter sovereignty, that he meant to advance as his final and inevitable
      deduction from "the great principles" of the Nebraska Bill. This he knew,
      and they were sure, would give antislavery an unbroken round of solid
      victories in all the Territories. The South feared it much more than they
      did the Republican theory: it was, in the language of their first orator,
      "a shortcut to all the ends of Sewardism."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Douglas's great difficulty was to produce any belief in his
      sincerity. At home, in Illinois, the Republicans distrusted him almost to
      a man; and at Washington, among his peers in the Senate and the House, it
      seemed necessary for him to repeat his plans and promises very often, and
      to mingle with them bitter and passionate declamations against the South.
      At last, however, he succeeded,&mdash;partially, at least. Senator Wilson
      believed him devoutly; Mr. Burlingame said his record was "laid up in
      light;" Mr. Colfax, Mr. Blair, and Mr. Covode were convinced; and
      gentlemen of the press began industriously to prepare the way for his
      entrance into the Republican party. Mr. Greeley was thoroughly possessed
      by the new idea, and went about propagating and enforcing it with all his
      might. Among all the grave counsellors employed in furthering Mr.
      Douglas's defection, it is singular that only one man of note steadily
      resisted his admission to a place of leadership in the Republican ranks:
      Judge Trumbull could not be persuaded; he had no faith in the man who
      proposed to desert, and had some admonitions to deliver, based upon the
      history of recent events. He was willing enough to take him "on
      probation," but wholly opposed to giving him any power. Covode was
      employed to mollify Judge Trumbull; but he met with no success, and went
      away without so much as delivering the message with which Mr. Douglas had
      charged him. The message was a simple proposition of alliance with the
      home Republicans, to the effect, that, if they agreed to return him to the
      Senate in 1858, he would fight their Presidential battle in 1860. Judge
      Trumbull did not even hear it, but he was well assured that Mr. Douglas
      was "an applicant for admission into the Republican party." "It was
      reported to me at that time," said he, "that such was the fact; and such
      appeared to be the universal understanding, among the Republicans at
      Washington. I will state another fact,&mdash;I almost quarrelled with some
      of my best Republican friends in 'regard to this matter. I was willing to
      receive Judge Douglas into the Republican party on probation; but I was
      not, as these Republican friends were, willing to receive him, and place
      him at the head of our ranks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the latter part of April, 1858, a Democratic State Convention met
      in Illinois, and, besides nominating a ticket for State officers, indorsed
      Mr. Douglas. This placed him in the field for re-election as an
      Anti-Lecompton Democrat; but it by no means shook the faith of his
      recently acquired Republican friends: they thought it very natural, under
      the circumstances, that his ways should be a little devious, and his
      policy somewhat dark. He had always said he could do more for them by
      seeming to remain within the Democratic party; and they looked upon this
      latest proceeding&mdash;his practical nomination by a Democratic
      convention&mdash;as the foundation for an act of stupendous treason
      between that time and the Presidential election. They continued to press
      the Republicans of Illinois to make no nomination against him,&mdash;to
      vote for him, to trust him, to follow him, as a sincere and manifestly a
      powerful antislavery leader. These representations had the effect of
      seducing away, for a brief time, Mr. Wash-burne and a few others among the
      lesser politicians of the State; but, when they found the party at large
      irrevocably opposed to the scheme, they reluctantly acquiesced in what
      they could not prevent,&mdash;Mr. Lincoln's nomination. But the plot made
      a profound impression on Mr. Lincoln's mind: it proved the existence of
      personal qualities in Mr. Douglas, which, to a simpler man, were
      unimaginable and inexplicable. A gentleman once inquired of Mr. Lincoln
      what he thought of Douglas's chances at Charleston. "Well," he replied,
      "were it not for certain matters that I know transpired, which I regarded
      at one time among the impossibilities, I would say he stood no possible
      chance. I refer to the fact, that, in the Illinois contest with myself, he
      had the sympathy and support of Greeley, of Burlingame, and of Wilson of
      Massachusetts, and other leading Republicans; that, at the same time, he
      received the support of Wise, and the influence of Breckinridge, and other
      Southern men; that he took direct issue with the administration, and
      secured, against all its power, one hundred and twenty-five thousand out
      of one hundred and thirty thousand Democratic votes cast in the State. A
      man that can bring such influence to bear with his own exertions may play
      the devil at Charleston."
    </p>
    <p>
      From about the 7th to the 16th of June, 1858, Mr. Lincoln was busily
      engaged writing a speech: he wrote it in scraps,&mdash;a sentence now, and
      another again. It was originally scattered over numberless little pieces
      of paper, and was only reduced to consecutive sheets and connected form as
      the hour for its delivery drew near. It was to be spoken on or about the
      16th, when the Republican State Convention would assemble at Springfield,
      and, as Mr. Lincoln anticipated, would nominate him for senator in
      Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 13th of June, Mr. Dubois, the State auditor, entered the office
      of Lincoln &amp; Herndon, and found Mr. Lincoln deeply intent upon the
      speech. "Hello, Lincoln! what <i>are</i> you writing?" said the auditor.
      "Come, tell me."&mdash;"I sha'n't tell you," said Lincoln. "<i>It is none
      of your business</i>, Mr. Auditor. Come, sit down, and let's be jolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th, the convention, numbering, with delegates and alternates,
      about a thousand men, met, and passed unanimously the following
      resolution:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Hon. Abraham Lincoln is our first and only choice for United States
      senator to fill the vacancy about to be created by the expiration of Mr.
      Douglas's term of office."
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Mr. Lincoln came early to his office, along with Mr. Herndon.
      Having carefully locked the door, and put the key in his own pocket, he
      pulled from his bosom the manuscript of his speech, and proceeded to read
      it slowly and distinctly. When he had finished the first paragraph, he
      came to a dead pause, and turned to his astounded auditor with the
      inquiry, "How do you like that? What do you think of it?"&mdash;"I think,"
      returned Mr. Herndon, "it is true; but is it entirely <i>politic</i> to
      read or speak it as it is written?"
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"That makes no difference," Mr. Lincoln said. "That expression is a
      truth of all human experience,&mdash;'a house divided against itself
      cannot stand;' and 'he that runs may read.' The proposition is
      indisputably true, and has been true for more than six thousand years; and&mdash;I
      will deliver it as written. I want to use some universally known figure,
      expressed in simple language as universally known, that may strike home to
      the minds of men, in order to rouse them to the peril of the times. I
      would rather be <i>defeated with this expression in</i> the speech, and it
      held up and discussed before the people, than <i>to be victorious without
      it.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be questioned whether Mr. Lincoln had a clear right to indulge in
      such a venture, as a representative party man in a close contest. He had
      other interests than his own in charge: he was bound to respect the
      opinions, and, if possible, secure the success, of the party which had
      made him its leader. He knew that the strange doctrine, so strikingly
      enunciated, would alienate many well-affected voters. Was it his duty to
      cast these away, or to keep them? He was not asked to sacrifice any
      principle of the party, or any opinion of his own previously expressed,
      but merely to forego the trial of an experiment, to withhold the
      announcement of a startling theory, and to leave the creed of the party as
      it came from the hands of its makers, without this individual supplement,
      of which they had never dreamed. It is evident that he had not always been
      insensible to the force of this reasoning. At the Bloomington Convention
      he had uttered the same ideas in almost the same words; and their novelty,
      their tendency, their recognition of a state of incipient civil war in a
      country for the most part profoundly peaceful,&mdash;these, and the bloody
      work which might come of their acceptance by a great party, had filled the
      minds of some of his hearers with the most painful apprehensions. The
      theory was equally shocking to them, whether as partisans or as patriots.
      Among them was Hon. T. Lyle Dickey, who sought Mr. Lincoln, and begged him
      to suppress them in future. He vindicated his speech as he has just
      vindicated it in the interview with Mr. Herndon; but, after much
      persuasion, he promised at length not to repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Mr. Herndon's turn to be surprised: the pupil had outstripped
      the teacher. He was intensely anxious for Mr. Lincoln's election: he
      feared the effect of this speech; and yet it was so exactly in accordance
      with his own faith, that he could not advise him to suppress it. It might
      be heresy to many others, but it was orthodoxy to him; and he was in the
      habit of telling the whole truth, without regard to consequences. If it
      cost a single defeat now, he was sure that its potency would one day be
      felt, and the wisdom of its present utterance acknowledged. He therefore
      urged Mr. Lincoln to speak it as he had written it, and to treat with the
      scorn of a prophet those who, having ears, would not hear, and, having
      eyes, would not see. The advice was not unacceptable, but Mr. Lincoln
      thought he owed it to other friends to counsel with them also.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a dozen gentlemen were called to meet in the Library Room in the
      State House. "After seating them at the round table," says John Armstrong,
      one of the number, "he read that clause or section of his speech which
      reads, 'a house divided against itself cannot stand,' &amp;c. He read it
      slowly and cautiously, so as to let each man fully understand it. After he
      had finished the reading, he asked the opinions of his friends as to the
      wisdom or policy of it. Every man among them condemned the speech in
      substance and spirit, and especially that section quoted above. They
      unanimously declared that the whole speech was too far in advance of the
      times; and they all condemned that section or part of his speech already
      quoted, as unwise and impolitic, if not false. William H. Herndon sat
      still while they were giving their respective opinions of its unwisdom and
      impolicy: then he sprang to his feet and said, 'Lincoln, deliver it just
      as it reads. If it is in advance of the times, let us&mdash;you and I, if
      no one else&mdash;lift the people to the level of this speech now, higher
      hereafter. The speech is true, wise, and politic, and will succeed now or
      in the future. Nay, it will aid you, if it will not make you President of
      the United States.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln sat still a short moment, rose from his chair, walked
      backwards and forwards in the hall, stopped and said, 'Friends, I have
      thought about this matter a great deal, have weighed the question well
      from all corners, and am thoroughly convinced the time has come when it
      should be uttered; and if it must be that I must go down because of this
      speech, then let me go down linked to truth,&mdash;die in the advocacy of
      what is right and just. This nation cannot live on injustice,&mdash;"a
      house divided against itself cannot stand," I say again and again.' This
      was spoken with some degree of emotion,&mdash;the effects of his love of
      truth, and sorrow from the disagreement of his friends with himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 17th this celebrated speech&mdash;known since as
      "The House-divided-against-itself Speech"&mdash;was delivered to an
      immense audience in the hall of the House of Representatives. Mr. Lincoln
      never penned words which had a more prodigious influence upon the public
      mind, or which more directly and powerfully affected his own career. It
      was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen of the Convention,&mdash;If we could first know where we are,
      and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how
      to do it. We are now far on into the fifth year since a policy was
      initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end
      to slavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that agitation
      had not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion, it
      will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. "A house
      divided against itself cannot stand." I believe this Government cannot
      endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to
      be dissolved,&mdash;I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it
      will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.
      Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the farther spread of it, and
      place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in
      course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till
      it shall become alike lawful in all the States,&mdash;old as well as new,
      North as well as South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have we no tendency to the latter condition? Let any one who doubts
      carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination,&mdash;piece
      of machinery, so to speak,&mdash;compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and
      the Dred-Scott Decision. Let him consider, not only what work the
      machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but also let him study
      the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if
      he can, to trace, the evidences of design and concert of action among its
      chief master-workers from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so far Congress only had acted; and an indorsement by the people, real
      or apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained and give
      chance for more. The New Year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more
      than half the States by State constitutions, and from most of the national
      territory by congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the
      struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition. This
      opened all the national territory to slavery, and was the first point
      gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      This necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as well
      as might be, in the notable argument of "<i>squatter sovereignty</i>"
      otherwise called "<i>sacred right of self-government;</i>" which latter
      phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government,
      was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this:
      that, if any one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be
      allowed to object. That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska Bill
      itself, in the language which follows: "It being the true intent and
      meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State,
      nor exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free
      to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject
      only to the Constitution of the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of "squatter
      sovereignty" and "sacred right of self-government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said opposition members, "let us be more specific,&mdash;let us
      amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory
      may exclude slavery."&mdash;"Not we," said the friends of the measure; and
      down they voted the amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a law-case involving
      the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having
      voluntarily taken him first into a Free State, and then a Territory
      covered by the congressional prohibition, and held him as a slave,&mdash;for
      a long time in each,&mdash;was passing through the United-States Circuit
      Court for the District of Missouri; and both the Nebraska Bill and lawsuit
      were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The negro's
      name was Dred Scott, which name now designates the decision finally made
      in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the then next Presidential election, the law-case came to, and was
      argued in, the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it
      was deferred until after the election. Still, before the election, Senator
      Trumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requests the leading advocate of the
      Nebraska Bill to state his opinion whether a people of a Territory can
      constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter
      answers, "That is a question for the Supreme Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      The election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such as
      it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement,
      however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred
      thousand votes; and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and
      satisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual Message, as
      impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and
      authority of the indorsement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court met again; did not announce their decision, but ordered
      a re-argument. The Presidential inauguration came, and still no decision
      of the court; but the incoming President, in his inaugural address,
      fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision,
      whatever it might he. Then, in a few days, came the decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the third point gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputed author of the Nebraska Bill finds an early occasion to make a
      speech at this Capitol indorsing the Dred-Scott Decision, and vehemently
      denouncing all opposition to it. The new President, too, seizes the early
      occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that
      decision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever
      been entertained. At length a squabble springs up between the President
      and the author of the Nebraska Bill, on the mere question of fact whether
      the Lecompton Constitution was, or was not, in any just sense, made by the
      people of Kansas; and, in that squabble, the latter declares that all he
      wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery
      be voted down or voted up. I do not understand his declaration, that he
      cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him
      other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the
      public mind,&mdash;the principle for which he declares he has suffered
      much, and is ready to suffer to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      And well may he cling to that principle! If he has any parental feeling,
      well may he cling to it! That principle is the only shred left of his
      original Nebraska doctrine. Under the Dred-Scott Decision, squatter
      sovereignty squatted out of existence,&mdash;tumbled down like temporary
      scaffolding; like the mould at the foundery, served through one blast, and
      fell back into loose sand; helped to carry an election, and then was
      kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the Republicans against
      the Lecompton Constitution involves nothing of the original Nebraska
      doctrine. That struggle was made on a point&mdash;the right of a people to
      make their own constitution&mdash;upon which he and the Republicans have
      never differed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The several points of the Dred-Scott Decision, in connection with Senator
      Douglas's "care-not" policy, constitute the piece of machinery in its
      present state of advancement. The working-points of that machinery are,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no
      descendant of such, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of
      that term as used in the Constitution of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event,
      of the benefit of this provision of the United States Constitution, which
      declares that "The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the
      privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, That, "subject to the Constitution of the United States,"
      neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from
      any United States Territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the
      Territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and
      thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a Free
      State makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will
      not decide, but will leave it to be decided by the courts of any Slave
      State the negro may be forced into by the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but if acquiesced in
      for a while, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to
      sustain the logical conclusion, that, what Dred Scott's master might
      lawfully do with Dred Scott in the free State of Illinois, every other
      master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand slaves in
      Illinois, or in any other Free State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska
      doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion,
      at least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted
      down or voted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows exactly where we now are, and partially, also, whither we are
      tending.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind
      over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things will
      now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were
      transpiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were to be left "perfectly free," "subject only to the
      Constitution." What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could
      not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche for the
      Dred-Scott Decision afterward to come in, and declare that perfect freedom
      of the people to be just no freedom at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was the amendment expressly declaring the right of the people to
      exclude slavery voted down? Plainly enough now: the adoption of it would
      have spoiled the niche for the Dred-Scott Decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was the court decision held up? Why even a senator's individual
      opinion withheld till after the Presidential election? Plainly enough now:
      the speaking out then would have damaged the "perfectly free" argument
      upon which the election was to be carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the
      delay of a re-argument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation
      in favor of the decision? These things look like the cautious patting and
      petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him, when it is
      dreaded that he may give the rider a fall. And why the hasty
      after-indorsements of the decision by the President and others?
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result
      of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions
      of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and
      by different workmen,&mdash;Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for
      instance,&mdash;and when we see these timbers joined together, and see
      they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and
      mortises, exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the
      different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a
      piece too many or too few,&mdash;not omitting even scaffolding&mdash;or,
      if a single piece be lacking, we can see the place in the frame exactly
      fitted and prepared to yet bring such piece in,&mdash;in such a case, we
      find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and
      James all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a
      common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should not be overlooked, that, by the Nebraska Bill, the people of a
      State as well as Territory were to be left "perfectly free" "subject only
      to the Constitution." Why mention a State? They were legislating for
      Territories, and not for or about States. Certainly the people of a State
      are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United States; but
      why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law? Why are
      the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein lumped
      together, and their relation to the Constitution therein treated as being
      precisely the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      While the opinion of the court by Chief-Justice Taney, in the Dred-Scott
      case, and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges, expressly
      declare that the Constitution of the United States neither permits
      Congress nor a Territorial Legislature to exclude slavery from any United
      States
    </p>
    <p>
      Territory, they all omit to declare whether or not the same Constitution
      permits a State, or the people of a State, to exclude it. Possibly, this
      was a mere omission; but who can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis had
      sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the
      people of a State to exclude slavery from their limits, just as Chase and
      Mace sought to get such declaration, in behalf of the people of a
      Territory, into the Nebraska Bill,&mdash;I ask, who can be quite sure that
      it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the
      other?
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over
      slavery is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using
      the precise idea, and almost the language too, of the Nebraska Act. On one
      occasion his exact language is, "Except in cases where the power is
      restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State
      is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction."
    </p>
    <p>
      In what cases the power of the State is so restrained by the United States
      Constitution is left an open question, precisely as the same question, as
      to the restraint on the power of the Territories, was left open in the
      Nebraska Act. Put that and that together, and we have another nice little
      niche, which we may ere long see filled with another Supreme Court
      decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not
      permit a State to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially
      be expected if the doctrine of "care not whether slavery be voted down or
      voted up" shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise
      that such a decision can be maintained when made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all
      the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming, and
      will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political dynasty
      shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that
      the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their State free; and we
      shall awake to the reality, instead, that the Supreme Court has made
      Illinois a Slave State.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all
      those who would prevent that consummation. That is what we have to do. But
      how can we best do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet
      whisper softly, that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there is
      with which to effect that object. They do not tell us, nor has he told us,
      that he wishes any such object to be effected. They wish us to infer all,
      from the facts that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of
      the dynasty; and that he has regularly voted with us, on a single point,
      upon which he and we have never differed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remind us that he is a very great man, and that the largest of us are
      very small ones. Let this be granted. But "a <i>living dog</i> is better
      than a <i>dead lion</i>." Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion for this work,
      is at least a caged and toothless one. How can he oppose the advances of
      slavery? He don't care any thing about it. His avowed mission is
      impressing the "public heart" to care nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A leading Douglas Democrat newspaper thinks Douglas's superior talent will
      be needed to resist the revival of the African slave-trade. Does Douglas
      believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching? He has not said so.
      Does he really think so? But, if it is, how can he resist it? For years he
      has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves
      into the new Territories. Can he possibly show that it is less a sacred
      right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest? And unquestionably
      they can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to
      one of a mere right of property; and as such, how can he oppose the
      foreign slave-trade,&mdash;how can he refuse that trade in that "property"
      shall be "perfectly free,"&mdash;unless he does it as a protection to the
      home production? And, as the home producers will probably not ask the
      protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser to-day
      than he was yesterday; that he may rightfully change when he finds himself
      wrong. But can we for that reason run ahead, and infer that he will make
      any particular change, of which he himself has given no intimation? Can we
      safely base our action upon any such vague inferences?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas's position,
      question his motives, or do aught that can be personally offensive to him.
      Whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on principle, so that our
      great cause may have assistance from his great ability, I hope to have
      interposed no adventitious obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But clearly he, is not now with us; he does not pretend to be; he does not
      promise ever to be. Our cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted
      by, its own undoubted friends,&mdash;those whose hands are free, whose
      hearts are in the work, who do care for the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred
      thousand strong. We did this under the single impulse of resistance to a
      common danger, with every external circumstance against us. Of strange,
      discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds,
      and formed and fought the battle through, under the constant hot fire of a
      disciplined, proud, and pampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter
      now?&mdash;now, when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered, and
      belligerent?
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is not doubtful. We shall not fail,&mdash;if we stand firm, we
      shall not fail. Wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it; but,
      sooner or later, the victory is sure to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech produced a profound impression upon men of all parties: the
      Democrats rejoiced in it, and reprobated it; the conservative Republicans
      received it coldly, and saw in it the sign of certain defeat. In the eyes
      of the latter it was a disheartening mistake at the outset of a momentous
      campaign,&mdash;a fatal error, which no policy or exertion could retrieve.
      Alone of all those directly affected by it, the Abolitionists, the
      compatriots of Mr. Herndon, heard in it the voice of a fearless leader,
      who had the wisdom to comprehend an unwelcome fact, and the courage to
      proclaim it at the moment when the delusion of fancied security and peace
      was most generally and fondly entertained. It was the "irrepressible
      conflict" which Mr. Seward had been preaching, and to which the one party
      had given almost as little credit as the other. Except a few ultraists
      here and there, nobody as yet had actually prepared his armor for this
      imaginary conflict, to which the nation was so persistently summoned,&mdash;and,
      indeed, none but those few seriously believed in the possibility of its
      existence. The Republican party had heretofore disavowed the doctrine with
      a unanimity nearly as great as that exhibited by the little council of Mr.
      Lincoln's immediate friends. It was therefore to be expected, that, when a
      slow, cautious, moderate man like Mr. Lincoln came forward with it in this
      startling fashion, it would carry dismay to his followers, and a cheering
      assurance to his enemies. But Mr. Lincoln was looking farther than this
      campaign: he was quietly dreaming of the Presidency, and edging himself to
      a place in advance, where he thought the tide might take him up in 1860.
      He was sure that sectional animosities, far from subsiding, would grow
      deeper and stronger with time; and for that reason the next nominee of the
      exclusively Northern party must be a man of radical views. "I think," says
      Mr. Herndon, "the speech was intended to take the wind out of Seward's
      sails;" and Mr. Herndon is not alone in his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after Mr. Lincoln spoke, one Dr. Long came into his office,
      and delivered to him a foretaste of the remarks he was doomed to hear for
      several months. "Well, Lincoln," said he, "that foolish speech of yours
      will kill you,&mdash;will defeat you in this contest, and probably for all
      offices for all time to come. I am sorry, sorry,&mdash;very sorry: I wish
      it was wiped out of existence. Don't you wish it, now?" Mr. Lincoln had
      been writing during the doctor's lament; but at the end of it he laid down
      his pen, raised his head, lifted his spectacles, and, with a look half
      quizzical, half contemptuous, replied, "Well, doctor, if I had to draw a
      pen across, and erase my whole life from existence, and I had one poor
      gift or choice left, as to what I should save from the wreck, I should
      choose that speech, and leave it to the world unerased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard Swett, than whom there was no more gifted man, nor a better judge
      of political affairs, in Illinois, is convinced that "the first ten lines
      of that speech defeated him." "The sentiment of the 'house divided against
      itself' seemed wholly inappropriate," says Mr. Swett. "It was a speech
      made at the commencement of a campaign, and apparently made for the
      campaign. Viewing it in this light alone, nothing could have been more
      unfortunate or inappropriate. It was saying first the wrong thing; yet he
      saw that it was an abstract truth, and standing by the speech would
      ultimately find him in the right place. I was inclined at the time to
      believe these words were hastily and inconsiderately uttered; but
      subsequent facts have convinced me they were deliberate and had been
      matured.... In the summer of 1859, when he was dining with a party of his
      intimate friends at Bloomington, the subject of his Springfield speech was
      discussed. We all insisted that it was a great mistake; but he justified
      himself, and finally said, 'Well, gentlemen, you may think that speech was
      a mistake; but I never have believed it was, and you will see the day when
      you will consider it was the wisest thing I ever said.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      John T. Stuart was a family connection of the Todds and Edwardses, and
      thus also of Lincoln. Mr. C. C. Brown married Mr. Stuart's daughter, and
      speaks of Mr. Lincoln as "our relative." This gentleman says, "The
      Todd-Stuart-Edwards family, with preacher and priest, dogs and servants,
      got mad at Mr. Lincoln because he made 'The House-divided-against-itself
      Speech.' He flinched, dodged, said he would explain, and did explain, in
      the Douglas debates."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was difficult to explain: explanations of the kind are generally
      more hurtful than the original offence. Accordingly, Mr. Herndon reports
      in his broad, blunt way, that "Mr. Lincoln met with many cold shoulders
      for some time,&mdash;nay, during the whole canvass with Douglas." At the
      great public meetings which characterized that campaign, "you could hear,
      from all quarters in the crowd, Republicans saying, 'Damn that fool
      speech! it will be the cause of the death of Lincoln and the Republican
      party. Such folly! such nonsense! Damn it!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 1840 Lincoln and Douglas had appeared before the people, almost as
      regularly as the elections came round, to discuss, the one against the
      other, the merits of parties, candidates, and principles. Thus far Mr.
      Lincoln had been in a certain sense the pursuer: he had lain in wait for
      Mr. Douglas; he had caught him at unexpected turns and upon sharp points;
      he had mercilessly improved the advantage of Mr. Douglas's long record in
      Congress to pick apart and to criticise, while his own was so much more
      humble and less extensive. But now at last they were abreast, candidates
      for the same office, with a fair field and equal opportunities. It was the
      great crisis in the lives of both. Let us see what they thought of each
      other; and, in the extracts which convey the information, we may also get
      a better idea of the character of each for candor, generosity, and
      truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Holland quotes from one of Mr. Lincoln's unpublished manuscripts as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-two years ago, Judge Douglas and I first became acquainted: we
      were both young then,&mdash;he a trifle younger than I. Even then we were
      both ambitious,&mdash;I, perhaps, quite as much so as he. With me the race
      of ambition has been a failure,&mdash;a flat failure; with him it has been
      one of splendid success. His name fills the nation, and is not unknown
      even in foreign lands. I affect no contempt for the high eminence he has
      reached,&mdash;so reached that the oppressed of my species might have
      shared with me in the elevation, I would rather stand on that eminence
      than wear the richest crown that ever pressed a monarch's brow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in the pending campaign, Mr. Lincoln said, "There is still another
      disadvantage under which we labor, and to which I will invite your
      attention. It arises out of the relative positions of the two persons who
      stand before the State as candidates for the Senate. Senator Douglas is of
      worldwide renown. All the anxious politicians of his party, or who had
      been of his party for years past, have been looking upon him as certainly,
      at no distant day, to be the President of the United States. They have
      seen, in his round, jolly, fruitful face, post-offices, land-offices,
      marshalships, and cabinet appointments, chargéships and foreign missions,
      bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold
      of by their greedy hands. And as they have been gazing upon this
      attractive picture so long, they cannot, in the little distraction that
      has taken place in the party, bring themselves to give up the charming
      hope; but, with greedier anxiety, they rush about him, sustain him, and
      give him marches, triumphal entries, and receptions, beyond what, even in
      the days of his highest prosperity, they could have brought about in his
      favor. On the contrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President. In my
      poor, lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were
      sprouting out. These are disadvantages, all taken together, that the
      Republicans labor under. We have to fight this battle upon principle, and
      principle alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now hear Mr. Douglas. In their first joint debate at Ottawa, he said, "In
      the remarks I have made on this platform, and the position of Mr. Lincoln
      upon it, I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that
      gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five years. There were many
      points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted. We were both
      comparatively boys, and both struggling with poverty in a strange land. I
      was a schoolteacher in the town of Winchester, and he a flourishing
      grocery-keeper in the town of Salem. He was more successful in his
      occupation than I was in mine, and hence more fortunate in this world's
      goods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirable
      skill every thing which they undertake. I made as good a school-teacher as
      I could; and, when a cabinet-maker, I made a good bedstead and tables,
      although my old boss said I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries
      than with any thing else; but I believe that Lincoln was always more
      successful in business than I, for his business enabled him to get into
      the Legislature. I met him there, however, and had a sympathy with him,
      because of the up-hill struggle we both had in life. He was then just as
      good at telling an anecdote as now. He could beat any of the boys
      wrestling, or running a foot-race, in pitching quoits, or tossing a
      copper; could ruin more liquor than all of the boys of the town together;
      and the dignity and impartiality with which he presided at a horse-race or
      fist-fight excited the admiration and won the praise of everybody that was
      present and participated. I sympathized with him because he was struggling
      with difficulties; and so was I. Mr. Lincoln served with me in the
      Legislature in 1836, when we both retired, and he subsided, or became
      submerged; and he was lost sight of as a public man for some years. In
      1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated proviso, and the abolition
      tornado swept over the country, Lincoln again turned up as a member of
      Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then in the Senate of the
      United States, and was glad to welcome my old friend and companion. Whilst
      in Congress, he distinguished himself by his opposition to the Mexican
      War, taking the side of the common enemy against his own country; and,
      when he returned home, he found that the indignation of the people
      followed him everywhere, and he was again submerged, or obliged to retire
      into private life, forgotten by his former friends. He came up again in
      1854, just in time to make this abolition or Black Republican platform, in
      company with Giddings, Lovejoy, Chase, and Fred. Douglas, for the
      Republican party to stand upon. Trumbull, too, was one of our own
      contemporaries."
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous pages of this book present fully enough for our present purpose
      the issues upon which this canvass was made to turn. The principal
      speeches, the joint debates, with five separate and independent speeches
      by Mr. Lincoln, and three by Mr. Douglas, have been collected and
      published under Mr. Lincoln's supervision in a neat and accessible volume.
      It is, therefore, unnecessary, and would be unjust, to reprint them here.
      They obtained at the time a more extensive circulation than such
      productions usually have, and exerted an influence which is very
      surprising to the calm reader of the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Douglas endeavored to prove, from Mr. Lincoln's Springfield speech,
      that he (Mr. Lincoln) was a self-declared Disunionist, in favor of
      reducing the institutions of all the States "to a dead uniformity," in
      favor of abolishing slavery everywhere,&mdash;an old-time abolitionist, a
      negropolist, an amalgamationist. This, with much vaunting of himself for
      his opposition to Lecompton, and a loud proclamation of "popular
      sovereignty," made the bulk of Mr. Douglas's speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln denied these accusations; he had no "thought of bringing about
      civil war," nor yet uniformity of institutions: he would not interfere
      with slavery where it had a lawful existence, and was not in favor of
      negro equality or miscegenation. He did, however, believe that Congress
      had the right to exclude slavery from the Territories, and ought to
      exercise it. As to Mr. Douglas's doctrine of popular sovereignty, there
      could be no issue concerning it; for everybody agreed that the people of a
      Territory might, when they formed a State constitution, adopt or exclude
      slavery as they pleased. But that a Territorial Legislature possessed
      exclusive power, or any power at all, over the subject, even Mr Douglas
      could not assert, inasmuch as the Dred-Scott Decision was plain and
      explicit the other way; and Mr. Douglas boasted that decision as the rule
      of his political conduct, and sought to impose it upon all parties as a
      perfect definition of the rights and duties of government, local and
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ottawa, Mr. Douglas put to Mr. Lincoln a series of questions, which,
      upon their next meeting (at Freeport), Mr. Lincoln answered as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at
      Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the
      party, then and since. If, in any interrogatories which I shall answer, I
      go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be
      perceived that no one is responsible but myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said thus much, I will take up the judge's interrogatories as I
      find them printed in "The Chicago Times," and answer them <i>seriatim</i>.
      In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the
      interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them. The first one of
      these interrogatories is in these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Question 1.&mdash;"I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he
      did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive-Slave
      Law."
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer.&mdash;I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the
      unconditional repeal of the Fugitive-Slave Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. 2.&mdash;"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as
      he did in 1854, against the admission of any more Slave States into the
      Union, even if the people want them."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I do not now, nor ever did, stand pledged against the admission
      of any more Slave States into the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. 3.&mdash;"I want to know whether he stands pledged against the
      admission of a new State into the Union with such a constitution as the
      people of that State may see fit to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into
      the Union, with such a constitution as the people of that State may see
      fit to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. 4.&mdash;"I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the
      abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the
      District of Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. 5.&mdash;"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the
      prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade
      between the different States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q. 6.&mdash;"I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit
      slavery in all the Territories of the United States, north as well as
      south of the Missouri Compromise line."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the
      right and duty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States
      Territories. [Great applause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Q 7.&mdash;"I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the
      acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited
      therein."
    </p>
    <p>
      A.&mdash;I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory;
      and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition,
      accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not agitate
      the slavery question among ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my friends, it will be perceived, upon an examination of these
      questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not
      pledged to this, that, or the other. The judge has not framed his
      interrogatories to ask me any thing more than this, and I have answered in
      strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that I
      am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which I have answered. But
      I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I am
      rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state
      what I really think upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive-Slave Law, I have never
      hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under
      the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States
      are entitled to a congressional slave law. Having said that, I have had
      nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive-Slave Law, further than
      that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the
      objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And
      inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or
      modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new
      subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission
      of any more Slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly, that
      I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to
      pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there
      would never be another Slave State admitted into the Union; but I must
      add, that, if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the
      Territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people
      shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the
      constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave
      constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among
      them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into
      the Union. [Applause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being,
      as I conceive, the same as the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of
      Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I
      should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of
      Columbia. I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to
      abolish it. Yet, as a member of Congress, I should not, with my present
      views, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the District of
      Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: First, that the
      abolition should be gradual; Second, That it should be on a vote of the
      majority of qualified voters in the District; and Third, That compensation
      should be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess
      I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the
      District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, "sweep from our
      capital that foul blot upon our nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here, that as to the
      question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States,
      I can truly answer, as I have, that I am pledged to nothing about it. It
      is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that
      would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself
      entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been
      prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really
      have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had
      sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I
      have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here and to Judge Douglas. I
      must say, however, that, if I should be of opinion that Congress does
      possess the constitutional power to abolish slave-trading among the
      different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that
      power unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to
      what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District
      of Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all
      Territories of the United States is full and explicit within itself, and
      cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine. So I suppose, in regard to
      the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory
      unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could
      add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood,
      than the answer which I have placed in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in all this the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose
      he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of
      opinions for one place, and another set for another place,&mdash;that I
      was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am saying
      here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to
      abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois; and I believe I am
      saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons, and render
      them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Douglas had presented his interrogatories on the 21st of August, and
      Mr. Lincoln did not answer them until the 27th. They had no meetings
      between those days; and Mr. Lincoln had ample time to ponder his replies,
      and consult his friends. But he did more: he improved the opportunity to
      prepare a series of insidious questions, which he felt sure Mr. Douglas
      could not possibly answer without utterly ruining his political prospects.
      Mr. Lincoln struggled for a great prize, unsuspected by the common mind,
      but the thought of which was ever present to his own. Mr. Douglas was a
      standing candidate for the Presidency; but as yet Mr. Lincoln was a very
      quiet one, nursing hopes which his modesty prevented him from obtruding
      upon others. He was wise enough to keep the fact of their existence to
      himself, and in the mean time to dig pitfalls and lay obstructions in the
      way of his most formidable competitors. His present purpose was not only
      to defeat Mr. Douglas for the Senate, but to "kill him,"&mdash;to get him
      out of the way finally and forever. If he could make him evade the
      Dred-Scott Decision, and deny the right of a Southern man to take his
      negroes into a Territory, and keep them there while it was a Territory, he
      would thereby sever him from the body of the Democratic party, and leave
      him the leader of merely a little half-hearted antislavery faction. Under
      such circumstances, Mr. Douglas could never be the candidate of the party
      at large; but he might serve a very useful purpose by running on a
      separate ticket, and dividing the great majority of conservative votes,
      which would inevitably elect a single nominee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln went to Chicago, and there intimated to some of his friends
      what he proposed to do. They attempted to dissuade him, because, as they
      insisted, if Mr. Douglas should answer that the Dred-Scott Decision might
      be evaded by the people of a Territory, and slavery prohibited in the face
      of it, the answer would draw to him the sympathies of the antislavery
      voters, and probably, of itself, defeat Mr. Lincoln. But, so long as Mr.
      Douglas held to the decision in good faith, he had no hope of more aid
      from that quarter than he had already received. It was therefore the part
      of wisdom to let him alone as to that point. Mr. Lincoln, on the contrary,
      looked forward to 1860, and was determined that the South should
      understand the antagonism between Mr. Douglas's latest conception of
      "squatter sovereignty," on the one hand, and the Dred-Scott Decision, the
      Nebraska Bill, and all previous platforms of the party, on the other. Mr.
      Douglas taught strange doctrines and false ones; and Mr. Lincoln thought
      the faithful, far and near, should know it. If Mr. Douglas was a
      schismatic, there ought to be a schism, of which the Republicans would
      reap the benefit; and therefore he insisted upon his questions. "That is
      no business of yours," said his friends. "Attend exclusively to your
      senatorial race, and let the slaveholder and Douglas fight out that
      question among themselves and for themselves. If you put the question to
      him, he will answer that the Dred-Scott Decision is simply an abstract
      rule, having no practical application."&mdash;"If he answers that way,
      he's a dead cock in the pit," responded Mr. Lincoln. "But that," said
      they, "is none of your business: you are concerned only about the
      senator-ship."&mdash;"No," continued Mr. Lincoln, "not alone <i>exactly</i>:
      I am killing larger game. The great battle of 1860 is worth a thousand of
      this senatorial race."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did accordingly propound the interrogatories as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all
      other respects, adopt a State constitution, and ask admission into the
      Union under it, before they have the requisite number of inhabitants
      according to the English Bill,&mdash;some ninety-three thousand,&mdash;will
      you vote to admit them?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against
      the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its
      limits?
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States
      cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing
      in, adopting, and following such decision as a rule of political action?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how
      such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first and fourth questions Mr. Douglas answered substantially in the
      affirmative. To the third he replied, that no judge would ever be guilty
      of the "moral treason" of making such a decision. But to the second&mdash;the
      main question, to which all the others were riders and make-weights&mdash;he
      answered as he was expected to answer. "It matters not," said he, "what
      way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question
      whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution:
      the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it, as they
      please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour
      anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. Those police
      regulations can only be established by the local Legislature; and, if the
      people are opposed to slavery, they will elect representatives to that
      body who will, by unfriendly legislation, effectually prevent the
      introduction of it into their midst."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was more than enough for Mr. Lincoln's purpose. It cut Mr.
      Douglas off from his party, and put him in a state of perfect antagonism
      to it. He firmly denied the power of Congress to restrict slavery; and he
      admitted, that, under the Dred-Scott Decision, all Territories were open
      to its entrance. But he held, that, the moment the slaveholder passed the
      boundary of a Territory, he was at the mercy of the squatters, a dozen or
      two of whom might get together in a legislature, and rob him of the
      property which the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and Mr. Douglas
      himself said he had an indefeasible right to take there. Mr. Lincoln knew
      that the Southern people would feel infinitely safer in the hands of
      Congress than in the hands of the squatters. If they regarded the
      Republican mode of excluding slavery as a barefaced usurpation, they would
      consider Mr. Douglas's system of confiscation by "unfriendly legislation"
      mere plain stealing. The Republicans said to them, "We will regulate the
      whole subject by general laws, which you participate with us in passing;"
      but Mr. Douglas offered them, as sovereign judges and legislators, the
      territorial settlers themselves,&mdash;squatters they might be,&mdash;whom
      the aid societies rushed into the new Territories for the very purpose of
      keeping slavery away. The new doctrine was admirably calculated to alarm
      and incense the South; and, following so closely Mr. Douglas's conduct in
      the Lecompton affair, it was very natural that he should now be
      universally regarded by his late followers as a dangerous heretic and a
      faithless turncoat. The result justified Mr. Lincoln's anticipations. Mr.
      Douglas did not fully develop his new theory, nor personally promulgate it
      as the fixed tenet of his faction, until the next year, when he embodied
      it in the famous article contributed by him to "Harper's Magazine." But it
      did its work effectually; and, when parties began to marshal for the great
      struggle of 1860, Mr. Douglas was found to be, not precisely what he had
      promised,&mdash;a Republican, "fighting their battles,"&mdash;but an
      independent candidate, upon an independent platform, dividing the
      opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln pointed out on the spot the wide difference between Mr.
      Douglas's present views and those he had previously maintained with such
      dogged and dogmatic persistence. "The new state of the case" had induced
      "the Judge to sheer away from his original ground." The new theory was
      false in law, and could have no practical application. The history of the
      country showed it to be a naked humbug, a demagogue's imposture. Slavery
      was established in all this country, without "local police regulations" to
      protect it. Dred Scott himself was held in a Territory, not only without
      "local police regulations" to favor his bondage, but in defiance of a
      general law which prohibited it. A man who believed that the Dred-Scott
      Decision was the true interpretation of the Constitution could not refuse
      to negro slavery whatever protection it needed in the Territories without
      incurring the guilt of perjury. To say that slave property might be
      constitutionally confiscated, destroyed, or driven away from a place where
      it was constitutionally protected, was such an absurdity as Mr. Douglas
      alone in this evil strait was equal to; the proposition meaning, as he
      said on a subsequent occasion, "no less than that a thing may lawfully be
      driven away from a place where it has a lawful right to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that answer at Freeport," as Mr. Herndon has it, Douglas "instantly
      died. The red-gleaming Southern tomahawk flashed high and keen. Douglas
      was removed out of Lincoln's way. The wind was taken out of Seward's sails
      (by the House-divided Speech), and Lincoln stood out prominent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The State election took place on the 2d of November, 1858. Mr. Lincoln had
      more than four thousand majority of the votes cast; but this was not
      enough to give him a majority in the Legislature. An old and inequitable
      apportionment law was still in operation; and a majority of the members
      chosen under it were, as it was intended by the law-makers they should be,
      Democrats. In the Senate were fourteen Democrats to eleven Republicans;
      and in the House, forty Democrats to thirty-five Republicans. Mr. Douglas
      was, of course, re-elected, and Mr. Lincoln bitterly disappointed. Some
      one asked Mr. Lincoln how he felt when the returns came in. He replied,
      "that he felt like the boy that stumped his toe,&mdash;'it hurt too bad to
      laugh, and he was too big to cry!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this canvass Mr. Lincoln earned a reputation as a popular debater
      second to that of no man in America,&mdash;certainly not second to that of
      his famous antagonist. He kept his temper; he was not prone to
      personalities; he indulged in few anecdotes, and those of a decent
      character; he was fair, frank, and manly; and, if the contest had shown
      nothing else, it would have shown, at least, that "Old Abe" could behave
      like a well-bred gentleman under very trying circumstances. His marked
      success in these discussions was probably no surprise to the people of the
      Springfield District, who knew him as well as, or better than, they did
      Mr. Douglas. But in the greater part of the State, and throughout the
      Union the series of brilliant victories successively won by an obscure man
      over an orator of such wide experience and renown was received with
      exclamations of astonishment, alike by listeners and readers. It is true
      that many believed, or pretended to believe, that he was privately tutored
      and "crammed" by politicians of greater note than himself; and, when the
      speeches were at last collected and printed together, it was alleged that
      Mr. Lincoln's had been re-written or extensively revised by Mr. Judd,
      Judge Logan, Judge Davis, or some one else of great and conceded
      abilities.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the winter of 1858-9, Mr. Lincoln, having no political business on
      hand, appeared before the public in the character of lecturer, having
      prepared himself with much care. His lecture was, or might have been,
      styled, "All Creation is a mine, and every man a miner." He began with
      Adam and Eve, and the invention of the "fig-leaf apron," of which he gave
      a humorous description, and which he said was a "joint operation." The
      invention of letters, writing, printing, of the application of steam, of
      electricity, he classed under the comprehensive head of "inventions and
      discoveries," along with the discovery of America, the enactment of
      patent-laws, and the "invention of negroes, or the present mode of using
      them." Part of the lecture was humorous; a very small part of it actually
      witty; and the rest of it so commonplace that it was a genuine
      mortification to his friends. He delivered it at two or three points, and
      then declined all further invitations. To one of these he replied, in
      March, as follows: "Your note, inviting me to deliver a lecture in
      Gales-burgh, is received. I regret to say I cannot do so now: I must stick
      to the courts a while. I read a sort of a lecture to three different
      audiences during the last month and this; but I did so under circumstances
      which made it a waste of no time whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Douglas discussion many of the leaders of the Republican party
      believed, and the reader will agree had some foundation for the belief,
      that Mr. Lincoln was one of the greatest and best men in the party. It was
      natural, therefore, that many eyes should be turned towards him for the
      coming Presidential nomination. He had all the requisites of an available
      candidate: he had not been sufficiently prominent in national politics to
      excite the jealousies of powerful rivals; he was true, manly, able; he was
      pre-eminently a man of the people; he had sprung from a low family in the
      lowest class of society; he had been a rail-splitter, a flat-boatman, a
      grocery-keeper,&mdash;every thing that could commend him to the "popular
      heart." His manners, his dress, his stories, and his popular name and
      style of "Honest Old Abe," pointed to him as a man beside whose "running
      qualities" those of Taylor and Harrison were of slight comparison. That he
      knew all this, and thought of it a great deal, no one can doubt; and in
      the late campaign he had most adroitly opened the way for the realization
      of his hopes. But he knew very well that a becoming modesty in a "new man"
      was about as needful as any thing else. Accordingly, when a Mr. Pickett
      wrote him on the subject in March, 1859, he replied as follows: "Yours of
      the 2d instant, inviting me to deliver my lecture on 'Inventions' in Rock
      Island, is at hand, and I regret to be unable from press of business to
      comply therewith. In regard to the other matter you speak of, I beg that
      you will not give it a further mention. I do not think I am fit for the
      Presidency."
    </p>
    <p>
      But in April the project began to be agitated in his own town. On the 27th
      of that month, he was in the office of "The Central Illinois Gazette,"
      when the editor suggested his name. Mr. Lincoln, "with characteristic
      modesty, declined." But the editor estimated his "No" at its proper value;
      and he "was brought out in the next issue, May 4." Thence the movement
      spread rapidly and strongly. Many Republicans welcomed it, and,
      appreciating the pre-eminent fitness of the nomination, saw in it the
      assurance of certain victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The West was rapidly filling with Germans and other inhabitants of foreign
      birth. Dr. Canisius, a German, foreseeing Mr. Lincoln's strength in the
      near future, wrote to inquire what he thought about the restrictions upon
      naturalization recently adopted in Massachusetts, and whether he favored
      the fusion of all the opposition elements in the next canvass. He replied,
      that, as to the restrictions, he was wholly and unalterably opposed to
      them; and as to fusion, he was ready for it upon "Republican grounds," but
      upon no other. He would not lower "the Republican standard even by a
      hair's breadth." The letter undoubtedly had a good effect, and brought him
      valuable support from the foreign population.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a gentleman who desired his views about the tariff question, he replied
      cautiously and discreetly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Edward Wallace.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;I am here just now attending court. Yesterday, before I
      left Springfield, your brother, Dr. William S. Wallace, showed me a letter
      of yours, in which you kindly mention my name, inquire for my
      tariff-views, and suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the
      subject. I was an old Henry-Clay Tariff Whig. In old times I made more
      speeches on that subject than on any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not since changed my views. I believe yet, if we could have a
      moderate, carefully adjusted, protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as
      not to be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles, changes, and
      uncertain, ties, it would be better for us. Still, it is my opinion, that,
      just now, the revival of that question will not <i>advance the cause
      itself, or the man who revives it.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not thought much on the subject recently; but my general impression
      is, that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its old
      opponents to take it up; and then its old friends can join in and
      establish it on a more firm and durable basis. We, the old Whigs, have
      been entirely beaten out on the tariff question; and we shall not be able
      to re-establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated
      the necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it. With
      this view, I should prefer to not now write a public letter upon the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore wish this to be considered confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be very glad to receive a letter from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September Mr. Lincoln made a few masterly speeches in Ohio, where Mr.
      Douglas had preceded him on his new hobby of "squatter sovereignty," or
      "unfriendly legislation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton, Oct. 11,1859.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke at Columbus, Cincinnati, and several other points, each time
      devoting the greater part of his address to Mr. Douglas and his theories,
      as if the habit of combating that illustrious chieftain was hard to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December he went to Kansas, speaking at Elwood, Don-aphan, Troy,
      Atchison, and twice at Leavenworth. Wherever he went, he was met by vast
      assemblages of people. His speeches were principally repetitions of those
      previously made in Illinois; but they were very fresh and captivating to
      his new audiences. These journeys, which turned out to be continuous
      ovations, spread his name and fame far beyond the limits to which they had
      heretofore been restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter of 1859-60, he saw that his reputation had reached such
      a height, that he might honorably compete with such renowned men as
      Seward, Chase, and Bates, for the Presidential nomination. Mr. Jackson
      Grimshaw of Quincy urged him very strongly on the point. At length Mr.
      Lincoln consented to a conference with Grimshaw and some of his more
      prominent friends. It took place in a committee-room in the State House.
      Mr. Bushnell, Mr. Hatch (the Secretary of State), Mr. Judd (Chairman of
      the Republican State Central Committee), Mr. Peck, and Mr. Grimshaw were
      present,&mdash;all of them "intimate friends." They were unanimous in
      opinion as to the expediency and propriety of making him a candidate. But
      "Mr. Lincoln, with his characteristic modesty, doubted whether he could
      get the nomination, even if he wished it, and asked until the next morning
      to answer us.... The next day he authorized us to consider him, and work
      for him, if we pleased, as a candidate for the Presidency."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in October, 1859, that Mr. Lincoln received an invitation to speak
      in New York. It enchanted him: no event of his life had given him more
      heartfelt pleasure. He went straight to his office, and, Mr. Herndon says,
      "looked pleased, not to say <i>tickled</i>. He said to me, 'Billy, I am
      invited to deliver a lecture in New York. Shall I go?'&mdash;'By all
      means,' I replied; 'and it is a good opening too.'&mdash;'If you were in
      my fix, what subject would you choose?' said Lincoln. 'Why, a political
      one: that's your forte,' I answered." Mr. Herndon remembered his partner's
      previous "failure,&mdash;utter failure," as a lecturer, and, on this
      occasion, dreaded excessively his choice of a subject. "In the absence of
      a friend's advice, Lincoln would as soon take the Beautiful for a subject
      as any thing else, when he had absolutely no sense of it." He wrote in
      response to the invitation, that he would avail himself of it the coming
      February, provided he might be permitted to make a political speech, in
      case he found it inconvenient to get up one of another kind. He had
      purposely set the day far ahead, that he might thoroughly prepare himself;
      and it may safely be said, that no effort of his life cost him so much
      labor as this one. Some of the party managers who were afterwards put to
      work to verify its statements, and get it out as a campaign document, are
      alleged to have been three weeks in finding the historical records
      consulted by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of February, 1860, he arrived in New York. It was Saturday,
      and he spent the whole day in revising and retouching his speech. The next
      day he heard Beecher preach, and on Monday wandered about the city to see
      the sights. When the committee under whose auspices he was to speak waited
      upon him, they found him dressed in a sleek and shining suit of new black,
      covered with very apparent creases and wrinkles, acquired by being packed
      too closely and too long in his little valise. He felt uneasy in his new
      clothes and a strange place. His confusion was increased when the
      reporters called to get the printed slips of his speech in advance of its
      delivery. Mr. Lincoln knew nothing of such a custom among the orators, and
      had no slips. He was, in fact, not quite sure that the press would desire
      to publish his speech. When he reached the Cooper Institute, and was
      ushered into the vast hall, he was surprised to see the most cultivated
      men of the city awaiting him on the stand, and an immense audience
      assembled to hear him. Mr. Bryant introduced him as "an eminent citizen of
      the West, hitherto known to you only by reputation." Mr. Lincoln then
      began, in low, monotonous tones, which gradually became louder and
      clearer, the following speech:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. President and Fellow-Citizens of New York,&mdash;The facts with which
      I shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is there any
      thing new in the general use I shall make of them. If there shall be any
      novelty, it will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the
      inferences and observations following that presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his speech last autumn, at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in "The New-York
      Times," Senator Douglas said,&mdash;"Our fathers, when they framed the
      government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and
      even better than we do now."
    </p>
    <p>
      I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so
      adopt it, because it furnishes a precise and agreed starting-point for the
      discussion between Republicans and that wing of Democracy headed by
      Senator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry, "What was the understanding
      those fathers had of the questions mentioned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the frame of government under which we live?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer must be, "The Constitution of the United States." That
      Constitution consists of the original, framed in 1787 (and under which the
      present Government first went into operation), and twelve subsequently
      framed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the
      "thirty-nine" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our
      fathers who framed that part of the present Government. It is almost
      exactly true to say they framed it; and it is altogether true to say they
      fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that
      time. Their names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite
      all, need not now be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take these "thirty-nine," for the present, as being "our fathers, who
      framed the Government under which we live."
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the question which, according to the text, those fathers
      understood just as well, and even better than we do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this: Does the proper division of local from Federal authority, or
      any thing in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government control as to
      slavery in our Federal Territories?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the negative.
      This affirmative and denial form an issue; and this issue, this question,
      is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now inquire whether the "thirty-nine," or any of them, ever acted
      upon this question; and, if they did, how they acted upon it,&mdash;how
      they expressed that better understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1784,&mdash;three years before the Constitution,&mdash;the United
      States then owning the North-western Territory, and no other, the Congress
      of the Confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery
      in that Territory; and four of the "thirty-nine" who afterward framed the
      Constitution were in that Congress, and voted on that question. Of these,
      Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the
      prohibition; thus showing, that, in their understanding, no line dividing
      local from Federal authority, nor any thing else, properly forbade the
      Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The
      other of the four, James McHenry, voted against the prohibition, showing
      that, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1787&mdash;still before the Constitution, but while the Convention was
      in session framing it, and while the North-western Territory still was the
      only Territory owned by the United States&mdash;the same question of
      prohibiting slavery in the Territory again came before the Congress of the
      Confederation; and three more of the "thirty-nine" who afterward signed
      the Constitution were in that Congress, and voted on the question. They
      were William Blount, William Few, and Abraham Baldwin; and they all voted
      for the prohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line
      dividing local from Federal authority, nor any thing else, properly
      forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal
      territory. This time the prohibition became a law, being part of what is
      now well known as the Ordinance of '87.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of Federal control of slavery in the Territories seems not to
      have been directly before the convention which framed the original
      Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the "thirty-nine," or any
      of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that
      precise question.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1789, by the First Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act
      was passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of
      slavery in the North-western Territory. The bill for this act was reported
      by one of the "thirty-nine,"&mdash;Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of
      the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went through all its
      stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches
      without yeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage. In this
      Congress there were sixteen of the "thirty-nine" fathers who framed the
      original Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, William S.
      Johnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thomas Fitzsimmons, William Few,
      Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Patterson, George Clymer, Richard
      Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carrol, James Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from
      Federal authority, nor any thing in the Constitution, properly forbade
      Congress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their
      fidelity to correct principle, and their oath to support the Constitution,
      would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, George Washington, another of the "thirty-nine," was then President
      of the United States, and, as such, approved and signed the bill, thus
      completing its validity as a law, and thus showing, that, in his
      understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor any
      thing in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to
      slavery in Federal territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North
      Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the
      State of Tennessee; and a few years later Georgia ceded that which now
      constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of
      cession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal
      Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country. Besides this,
      slavery was then actually in the ceded country. Under these circumstances,
      Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit
      slavery within them. But they did interfere with it, take control of it,
      even there, to a certain extent. In 1798, Congress organized the Territory
      of Mississippi. In the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of
      slaves into the Territory, from any place without the United States, by
      fine, and giving freedom to slaves so brought. This act passed both
      branches of Congress without yeas and nays. In that Congress were three of
      the "thirty-nine" who framed the original Constitution: they were John
      Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin. They all, probably, voted for
      it. Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record,
      if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal
      authority, or any thing in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal
      Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1803 the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country. Our former
      territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States; but this
      Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation. In 1804 Congress
      gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes
      the State of Louisiana. New Orleans, lying within that part, was an old
      and comparatively large city. There were other considerable towns and
      settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with
      the people. Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery;
      but they did interfere with it, take control of it, in a more marked and
      extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi. The substance of
      the provision therein made, in relation to slaves, was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First, That no slave should be imported into the Territory from foreign
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into
      the United States since the first day of May, 1798.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, That no slave should be carried into it, except by the owner, and
      for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine
      upon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the Congress which
      passed it there were two of the "thirty-nine:" they were Abraham Baldwin
      and Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable
      they both voted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without
      recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated
      either the line proper dividing local from Federal authority or any
      provision of the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1819-20 came and passed the Missouri question. Many votes were taken by
      yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases of
      the general question. Two of the "thirty-nine"&mdash;Rufus King and
      Charles Pinckney&mdash;were members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily
      voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises; while Mr.
      Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all
      compromises. By this Mr. King showed, that, in his understanding, no line
      dividing local from Federal authority, nor any thing in the Constitution,
      was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while
      Mr. Pinckney, by his votes, showed, that, in his understanding, there was
      some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the "thirty-nine," or of
      any of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enumerate the persons who thus acted as being four in 1784, three in
      1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in 1819-20,&mdash;there
      would be thirty-one of them. But this would be counting John Lang-don,
      Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read each twice, and
      Abraham Baldwin four times. The true number of those of the "thirty-nine"
      whom I have shown to have acted upon the question, which, by the text,
      they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown
      to have acted upon it in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our "thirty-nine" fathers, who
      framed the government under which we live, who have, upon their official
      responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question
      which the text affirms they "understood just as well, and even better than
      we do now;" and twenty-one of them&mdash;a clear majority of the
      "thirty-nine"&mdash;so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross
      political impropriety and wilful perjury if, in their understanding, any
      proper division between local and Federal authority, or any thing in the
      Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the
      Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories.
      Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so
      actions under such responsibility speak still louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the twenty-three voted against congressional prohibition of slavery
      in the Federal Territories in the instances in which they acted upon the
      question; but for what reasons they so voted is not known. They may have
      done so because they thought a proper division of local from Federal
      authority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in
      the way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against the
      prohibition, on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of
      expediency. No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can
      conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional
      measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote
      against a measure which he deems constitutional if, at the same time, he
      deems it inexpedient. It, therefore, would be unsafe to set down even the
      two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their
      understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any
      thing in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to
      slavery in Federal territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining sixteen of the "thirty-nine," so far as I have discovered,
      have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of
      Federal control of slavery in the Federal Territories. But there is much
      reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not
      have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it
      been manifested at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted
      whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however
      distinguished, other than the "thirty-nine" fathers who framed the
      original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted
      whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the
      "thirty-nine" even, on any other phase of the general question of slavery.
      If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases,
      as the foreign slave-trade, and the morality and policy of slavery
      generally, it would appear to us, that, on the direct question of Federal
      control of slavery in Federal Territories, the sixteen, if they had acted
      at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did. Among that
      sixteen were several of the most noted antislavery men of those times,&mdash;as
      Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Gouverneur Morris; while there was
      not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge
      of South Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum of the whole is, that of our "thirty-nine" fathers who framed the
      original Constitution, twenty-one&mdash;a clear majority of the whole&mdash;certainly
      understood that no proper division of local from Federal authority, nor
      any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control
      slavery in the Federal Territories; while all the rest probably had the
      same understanding. Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of our
      fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the text affirms that
      they understood the question better than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question
      manifested by the framers of the original Constitution. In and by the
      original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have
      already stated, the present frame of government under which we live
      consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and
      adopted since. Those who now insist that Federal control of slavery in
      Federal Territories violates the Constitution point us to the provisions
      which they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, they all fix
      upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original
      instrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred-Scott case, plant themselves
      upon the fifth amendment, which provides that "no person shall be deprived
      of property without due process of law;" while Senator Douglas and his
      peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing
      that "the powers not granted by the Constitution are reserved to the
      States respectively and to the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress
      which sat under the Constitution,&mdash;the identical Congress which
      passed the act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in
      the North-western Territory. Not only was it the same Congress, but they
      were the identical, same individual men, who, at the same time within the
      session, had under consideration, and in progress toward maturity, these
      constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting slavery in all the
      territory the nation then owned. The constitutional amendments were
      introduced before, and passed after, the act enforcing the Ordinance of
      '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the
      Ordinance, the constitutional amendments were also pending.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Congress, consisting in all of seventy-six members, including sixteen
      of the framers of the original Constitution, as before stated, were
      preeminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under
      which we live, which is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government
      to control slavery in the Federal Territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the
      two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and earned to maturity
      at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other? And does
      not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other
      affirmation, from the same mouth, that those who did the two things
      alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they were really
      inconsistent better than we,&mdash;better than he who affirms that they
      are inconsistent?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is surely safe to assume that the "thirty-nine" framers of the original
      Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the
      amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be
      fairly called "our fathers who framed the government under which we live."
      And so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his
      whole life, declared, that, in his understanding, any proper division of
      local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the
      Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories. I
      go a step farther. I defy any one to show that any living man in the whole
      world ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I might
      almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present
      century), declare, that, in his understanding, any proper division of
      local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the
      Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories. To
      those who now so declare, I give, not only "our fathers, who framed the
      government under which we live," but with them all other living men within
      the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall
      not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, and here, let me guard a little against being misunderstood. I do not
      mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did.
      To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience,&mdash;to
      reject all progress,&mdash;all improvement. What I do say is, that, if we
      would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we
      should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even
      their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and
      most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the
      question better than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any man, at this day, sincerely believes that a proper division of
      local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the
      Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he
      is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence
      and fair argument which he can. But he has no right to mislead others, who
      have less access to history and less leisure to study it, into the false
      belief that "our fathers, who framed the government under which we live,"
      were of the same opinion, thus substituting falsehood and deception for
      truthful evidence and fair argument. If any man at this day sincerely
      believes "our fathers, who framed the government under which we live,"
      used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them
      to understand that a proper division of local from Federal authority, or
      some part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control
      as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so. But he
      should, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring, that, in
      his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did
      themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by
      asserting that they "understood the question just as well, and even better
      than we do now."
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough. Let all who believe that "our fathers, who framed the
      government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and
      even better than we do now," speak as they spoke, and act as they acted
      upon it. This is all Republicans ask, all Republicans desire, in relation
      to slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an
      evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of
      and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and
      protection a necessity. Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be,
      not grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For this Republicans
      contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, if they would listen,&mdash;as I suppose they will not,&mdash;I
      would address a few words to the Southern people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would say to them, You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just
      people; and I consider, that, in the general qualities of reason and
      justice, you are not inferior to any other people. Still, when you speak
      of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the
      best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or
      murderers, but nothing like it to "Black Republicans." In all your
      contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional
      condemnation of "Black Republicanism" as the first thing to be attended
      to. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable
      prerequisite&mdash;license, so to speak&mdash;among you to be admitted or
      permitted to speak at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether
      this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long
      enough to hear us deny or justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden
      of proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that
      our party has no existence in your section,&mdash;gets no votes in your
      section. The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If
      it does, then in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get
      votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot
      escape this conclusion; and yet are you willing to abide by it? If you
      are, you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for
      we shall get votes in your section this very year. You will then begin to
      discover, as the truth plainly is, that your proof does not touch the
      issue. The fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your
      making, and not of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is
      primarily yours, and remains so until you show that we repel you by some
      wrong principle or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or
      practice, the fault is ours; but this brings us to where you ought to have
      started,&mdash;to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If
      our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit
      of ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are
      sectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on
      the question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your
      section; and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said
      on our side. Do you accept the challenge? No? Then you really believe that
      the principle which our fathers, who framed the government under which we
      live, thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and
      again upon their official oaths, is, in fact, so clearly wrong as to
      demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional
      parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address. Less than eight years
      before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United
      States, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition
      of slavery in the North-western Territory, which act embodied the policy
      of the Government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned
      that warning; and about one year after he penned it he wrote Lafayette
      that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing, in the
      same connection, his hope that we should some time have a confederacy of
      Free States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon
      this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or
      in our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast
      the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon
      you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington; and we
      commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right
      application of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you say you are conservative,&mdash;eminently conservative; while we
      are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is
      conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and
      untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old-policy on the point
      in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government
      under which we live; while you, with one accord, reject and scout and spit
      upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new. True,
      you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You
      have considerable variety of new propositions and plans; but you are
      unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some
      of you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a Congressional
      Slave-code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the
      Territories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining
      slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the "gur-reat
      pur-rinciple" that, "if one man would enslave another, no third man should
      object," fantastically called "popular sovereignty;" but never a man among
      you in favor of Federal prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories,
      according to the practice of our fathers, who framed the government under
      which we live. Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or
      an advocate in the century within which our Government originated.
      Consider, then, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and
      your charge of destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and
      stable foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it
      formerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny
      that we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy
      of the fathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and thence
      comes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have that question
      reduced to its former proportions? Go back to that old policy. What has
      been will be again, under the same conditions. If you would have the peace
      of the old times, re-adopt the precepts and policy of the old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it.
      And what is your proof? Harper's Ferry! John Brown! John Brown was no
      Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his
      Harper's Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that
      matter, you know it, or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are
      inexcusable to not designate the man, and prove the fact. If you do not
      know it, you are inexcusable to assert it, and especially to persist in
      the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You need
      not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true
      is simply malicious slander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the
      Harper's-Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and
      declarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We
      know we hold to no doctrine, and make no declarations, which were not held
      to and made by our fathers, who framed the government under which we live.
      You never deal fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it occurred,
      some important State elections were near at hand; and you were in evident
      glee with the belief, that, by charging the blame upon us, you could get
      an advantage of us in those elections. The elections came; and your
      expectations were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew, that, as
      to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not much
      inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. Republican doctrines and
      declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any
      interference whatever with your slaves, or with you about your slaves.
      Surely this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common with
      our fathers who framed the government under which we live, declare our
      belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not hear us declare even
      this. For any thing we say or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is
      a Republican party. I believe they would not, in fact, generally know it
      but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing. In your political
      contest among yourselves, each faction charges the other with sympathy
      with Black Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge, defines
      Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood, and thunder among
      the slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the
      Republican party was organized. What induced the Southampton Insurrection,
      twenty-eight years ago, in which, at least, three times as many lives were
      lost as at Harper's Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very elastic
      fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was got up by Black
      Republicanism. In the present state of things in the United States, I do
      not think a general, or even a very extensive slave insurrection, is
      possible. The indispensable concert of action cannot be attained. The
      slaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary free men,
      black or white, supply it. The explosive materials are everywhere in
      parcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied, the indispensable
      connecting trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their
      masters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for an
      uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals
      before some one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or
      mistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave revolution in
      Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring under peculiar
      circumstances. The gunpowder plot of British history, though not connected
      with the slaves, was more in point. In that case, only about twenty were
      admitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a
      friend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted the
      calamity. Occasional poisoning from the kitchen, and open or stealthy
      assassinations in the field, and local revolts extending to a score or so,
      will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no general
      insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this country for a long
      time. Whoever much fears, or much hopes, for such an event will be alike
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, "It is still in
      our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably,
      and in such slow degrees, as that the evil will wear off insensibly; and
      their places be, <i>pari passu</i>, filled up by free white laborers. If,
      on the contrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder
      at the prospect held up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of
      emancipation is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as
      to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding States only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of
      restraining the extension of the institution,&mdash;the power to insure
      that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is
      now free from slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown's effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It was
      an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the
      slaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves,
      with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed. 'That
      affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts, related in
      history, at the assassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods
      over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by
      Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little
      else than in his own execution. Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon, and
      John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry, were, in their philosophy,
      precisely the same. The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one
      case, and on New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of
      the two things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown,
      Helper's book, and the like, break up the Republican organization? Human
      action can be modified to some extent; but human nature cannot be changed.
      There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which
      cast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot destroy that
      judgment and feeling, that sentiment, by breaking up the political
      organization which rallies around it. You can scarcely scatter and
      disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your
      heaviest fire; but, if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the
      sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box,
      into some other channel? What would that other channel probably be? Would
      the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your
      constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not
      fully justified, were we proposing by the mere force of numbers to deprive
      you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution. But we are
      proposing no such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-under-stood
      allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into
      the Federal Territories, and hold them there as property; but no such
      right is specifically written in the Constitution. That instrument is
      literally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that such
      a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your purpose then, plainly stated, is, that you will destroy the
      government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution
      as you please on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule
      or ruin in all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, plainly stated, is your language to us. Perhaps you will say the
      Supreme Court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your
      favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum
      and decision, the courts have decided the question for you in a sort of
      way. The courts have substantially said, it is your constitutional right
      to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a
      divided court by a bare majority of the judges, and they not quite
      agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made
      as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning,
      and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact,&mdash;the
      statement in the opinion that "the right of property in a slave is
      distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in
      a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it. Bear in mind, the
      judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly
      affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is
      distinctly and expressly affirmed there,&mdash;"distinctly," that is, not
      mingled with any thing else; "expressly," that is, in words meaning just
      that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is
      affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to
      show that neither the word "slave" nor "slavery" is to be found in the
      Constitution, nor the word "property" even, in any connection with
      language alluding to the things slave or slavery, and that, wherever in
      that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a "person;" and
      wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is
      spoken of as "service or labor due,"&mdash;as a "debt" payable in service
      or labor. Also it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that
      this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them,
      was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that
      there could be property in man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To show all this is easy and certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice,
      is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken
      statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it is to be remembered that "our fathers, who framed the
      government under which we live,"&mdash;the men who made the Constitution,&mdash;decided
      this same constitutional question in our favor long ago,&mdash;decided it
      without a division among themselves, when making the decision; without
      division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made, and,
      so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon any mistaken
      statement of facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to
      break up this Government, unless such a court decision as yours is shall
      be at once submitted to, as a conclusive and final rule of political
      action?
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will not abide the election of a Republican President. In that
      supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say,
      the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through
      his teeth, "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you; and then you will be a
      murderer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, what the robber demanded of me&mdash;my money&mdash;was my
      own; and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my
      vote is my own; and threat of death to me to extort my money, and threat
      of destruction to the Union to extort my vote, can scarcely be
      distinguished in principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words now to Republicans. It is exceedingly desirable that all parts
      of this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony, one with
      another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even though much
      provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill-temper. Even though
      the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly
      consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of
      our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the
      subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we
      can, what will satisfy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered
      to them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against
      us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections
      are the rage now. Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing
      to do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so know
      because we know we never had any thing to do with invasions and
      insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the
      charge and the denunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: We must not only
      let them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them
      alone. This we know by experience is no easy task. We have been so trying
      to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no
      success. In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested
      our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince
      them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never
      detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.
    </p>
    <p>
      These natural, and apparently adequate means all failing, what will
      convince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery <i>wrong</i>,
      and join them in calling it <i>right</i>. And this must be done
      thoroughly,&mdash;done in <i>acts</i> as well as in <i>words</i>. Silence
      will not be tolerated: we must place ourselves avowedly with them.
      Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all
      declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses,
      in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves
      with greedy pleasure. We must pull down our Free-State Constitutions. The
      whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to
      slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed
      from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way. Most
      of them would probably say to us, "Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say
      what you please about slavery." But we do let them alone, have never
      disturbed them; so that, after all, it is what we say which dissatisfies
      them. They will continue to accuse us of doing until we cease saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of
      our Free-State constitutions. Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of
      slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it;
      and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow
      of these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the
      demand. It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole
      of this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they
      can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation. Holding, as they
      do, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot
      cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right and a
      social blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground, save our conviction
      that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and
      constitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should be silenced and
      swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality,
      its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its
      extension, its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily grant, if we
      thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if they
      thought it wrong. Their thinking it right, and our thinking it wrong, is
      the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it
      right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full
      recognition, as being right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield
      to them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In
      view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it
      is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual
      presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow
      it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in
      these Free States?
    </p>
    <p>
      If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty
      fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those
      sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and
      belabored,&mdash;contrivances such as groping for some middle ground
      between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should
      be neither a living man nor a dead man,&mdash;such as a policy of "don't
      care" on a question about which all true men do care,&mdash;such as Union
      appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Dis-unionists, reversing the
      divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous, to
      repentance,&mdash;such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to
      unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us,
      nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government, nor of
      dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might; and in
      that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning "The Tribune" presented a report of the speech, but, in
      doing so, said, "the tones, the gestures, the kindling eye, and the
      mirth-provoking look defy the reporter's skill.... No man ever before made
      such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience." "The
      Evening Post" said, "We have made room for Mr. Lincoln's speech,
      notwithstanding the pressure of other matters; and our readers will see
      that it was well worthy of the deep attention with which it was heard."
      For the publication of such arguments the editor was "tempted to wish"
      that his columns "were indefinitely elastic." And these are but fair
      evidences of the general tone of the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was much annoyed, after his return home, by the allegation
      that he had sold a "political speech," and had been generally governed by
      mercenary motives in his Eastern trip. Being asked to explain it, he
      answered as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, April 6, 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. F. McNeill, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March,
      enclosing a slip from "The Middleport Press." It is not true that I ever
      charged any thing for a political speech in my life; but this much is
      true. Last October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of
      speech in Mr. Beecher's church in Brooklyn,&mdash;$200 being offered in
      the first letter. I wrote that I could do it in February, provided they
      would take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other.
      They agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to be
      a political one. When I reached New York, I, for the first, learned that
      the place was changed to "Cooper Institute." I made the speech, and left
      for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for pay
      nor having any offered me. Three days after, a check for $200 was sent to
      me at N.H.; and I took it, <i>and did not know it was wrong</i>. My
      understanding now is, though I knew nothing of it at the time, that they
      did charge for admittance at the Cooper Institute, and that they took in
      more than twice $200.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made this explanation to you as a friend; but I wish no explanation
      made to our enemies. What they want is a squabble and a fuss: and that
      they can have if we explain; and they cannot have it if we don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned through New York from New England, I was told by the
      gentlemen who sent me the check, that a drunken vagabond in the club,
      having learned something about the $200, made the exhibition out of which
      "The Herald" manufactured the article quoted by "The Press" of your town.
    </p>
    <p>
      My judgment is, and therefore my request is, that you give no denial, and
      no explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I remain
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      From New York Mr. Lincoln travelled into New England, to visit his son
      Robert, who was a student at Harvard; but he was overwhelmed with
      invitations to address Republican meetings. In Connecticut he spoke at
      Hartford, Norwich, New Haven, Meriden, and Bridgeport; in Rhode Island, at
      Woonsocket; in New Hampshire, at Concord and Manchester. Everywhere the
      people poured out in multitudes, and the press lavished encomiums. Upon
      his speech at Manchester, "The Mirror," a neutral paper, passed the
      following criticisms of his style of oratory,&mdash;criticisms familiar
      enough to the people of his own State: "He spoke an hour and a half with
      great fairness, great apparent candor, and with wonderful interest. He did
      not abuse the South, the administration, or the Democrats, or indulge in
      any personalities, with the exception of a few hits at Douglas's notions.
      He is far from prepossessing in personal appearance, and his voice is
      disagreeable; and yet he wins your attention and good-will from the
      start.... He indulges in no flowers of rhetoric, no eloquent passages. He
      is not a wit, a humorist, or a clown; yet so great a vein of pleasantry
      and good-nature pervades what he says, gilding over a deep current of
      practical argument, he keeps his hearers in a smiling mood, with their
      mouths open ready to swallow all he says. His sense of the ludicrous is
      very keen; and an exhibition of that is the clincher of all his arguments,&mdash;not
      the ludicrous acts of persons, but ludicrous ideas. Hence he is never
      offensive, and steals away willingly into his train of belief persons who
      were opposed to him. For the first half-hour his opponents would agree
      with every word he uttered; and from that point he began to lead them off
      little by little, until it seemed as if he had got them all into his fold.
      He displays more shrewdness, more knowledge of the masses of mankind, than
      any public speaker we have heard since Long Jim Wilson left for
      California."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after the Norwich speech, Mr. Lincoln was met, or is said
      to have been met, in the cars by a preacher, one Gulliver,&mdash;a name
      suggestive of fictions. Gulliver says he told Mr. Lincoln that he thought
      his speech "the most remarkable one he ever heard." Lincoln doubted his
      sincerity; but Gulliver persisted. "Indeed, sir," said he, "I learned more
      of the art of public speaking last evening than I could from a whole
      course of lectures on rhetoric." Lincoln found he had in hand a clerical
      sycophant, and a little politician at that,&mdash;a class of beings whom
      he most heartily despised. Whereupon he began to quiz the fellow, and told
      him, for a most "remarkable circumstance," that the professors of Yale
      College were running all around after him, taking notes of his speeches,
      and lecturing about him to the classes. "Now," continued he, "I should
      like very much to know what it was in my speech which you thought so
      remarkable, and which interested my friend the professor so much?"
      Gulliver was equal to the occasion, and answered with an opinion which Mr.
      Bunsby might have delivered, and died, leaving to the world a reputation
      perfected by that single saying. "The clearness of your statements," said
      Gulliver, "the unanswerable style of your reasoning, and especially your
      illustrations, which were romance and pathos, and fun and logic, all
      welded together." Gulliver closed the interview with the cant peculiar to
      his kind. "Mr. Lincoln," said he, "may I say one thing to you before we
      separate?"&mdash;"Certainly; any thing you please," replied the
      good-natured old Abe. "You have just spoken," preached Gulliver, "of the
      tendency of political life in Washington to debase the moral convictions
      of our representatives there by the admixture of mere political
      expediency. You have become, by the controversy with Mr. Douglas, one of
      our leaders in this great struggle with slavery, which is undoubtedly the
      struggle of the nation and the age. What I would like to say is this, and
      I say it with a full heart: Be true to your principles; and we will be
      true to you, and God will be true to us all." To which modest, pious, and
      original observation, Mr. Lincoln responded, "I say Amen to that! Amen to
      that!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was not until May 9 and 10 that the Republican State Convention of
      Illinois met at Decatur. Mr. Lincoln was present, and is said to have been
      there as a mere "spectator." He had no special interest in the
      proceedings, and appears to have had no notion that any business relating
      to him was to be transacted that day. It was a very large and spirited
      body, comprising an immense number of delegates, among whom were the most
      brilliant, as well as the shrewdest men in the party. It was evident that
      something of more than usual importance was expected to transpire. A few
      moments after the convention organized, "Old Abe" was seen squatting, or
      sitting on his heels, just within the door of the Wigwam. Gov. Oglesby
      rose and said amid increasing silence, "I am informed that a distinguished
      citizen of Illinois, and one whom Illinois will ever delight to honor, is
      present; and I wish to move that this body invite him to a seat on the
      stand." Here the governor paused, as if to tease and dally, and work
      curiosity up to the highest point; but at length he shouted the magic name
      "<i>Abraham Lincoln!</i>" Not a shout, but a roar of applause, long and
      deep, shook every board and joist of the Wigwam. The motion was seconded
      and passed. A rush was made for the hero that sat on his heels. He was
      seized, and jerked to his feet. An effort was made to "jam him through the
      crowd" to his place of honor on the stage; but the crowd was too dense,
      and it failed. Then he was "troosted,"&mdash;lifted up bodily,&mdash;and
      lay for a few seconds sprawling and kicking upon the heads and shoulders
      of the great throng. In this manner he was gradually pushed toward the
      stand, and finally reached it, doubtless to his great relief, "in the arms
      of some half-dozen gentlemen," who set him down in full view of his
      clamorous admirers. "The cheering was like the roar of the sea. Hats were
      thrown up by the Chicago delegation, as if hats were no longer useful."
      Mr. Lincoln rose, bowed, smiled, blushed, and thanked the assembly as well
      as he could in the midst of such a tumult. A gentleman who saw it all
      says, "I then thought him one of the most diffident and worst-plagued men
      I ever saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      At another stage of the proceedings, Gov. Oglesby rose again with another
      provoking and mysterious speech. "There was," he said, "an old Democrat
      outside who had something he wished to present to this Convention."&mdash;"Receive
      it!" "Receive it!" cried some. "What is it?" "What is it?" screamed some
      of the lower Egyptians, who had an idea the old Democrat might want to
      blow them up with an infernal machine. But the party for Oglesby and the
      old Democrat was the stronger, and carried the vote with a tremendous
      hurrah. The door of the Wigwam opened; and a fine, robust old fellow, with
      an open countenance and bronzed cheeks, marched into the midst of the
      assemblage, bearing on his shoulder "two small triangular heart rails,"
      surmounted by a banner with this inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TWO RAILS,
    </p>
    <p>
      FROM A LOT MADE BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND JOHN HANKS, IN THE SANGAMON BOTTOM,
      IN THE YEAR 1830.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="image-0013" id="image-0013">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/489.jpg" alt="Uncle John Hanks 489 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The sturdy bearer was old John Hanks himself, enjoying the great field-day
      of his life. He was met with wild and tumultuous cheers, prolonged through
      several minutes; and it was observed that the Chicago and Central-Illinois
      men put up the loudest and longest. The whole scene was for a time simply
      tempestuous and bewildering. But it ended at last; and now the whole body,
      those in the secret and those out of it, clamored like men beside
      themselves for a speech from Mr. Lincoln, who in the mean time "blushed,
      but seemed to shake with inward laughter." In response to the repeated
      appeals he rose and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, I suppose you want to know something about those things"
      (pointing to old John and the rails). "Well, the truth is, John Hanks and
      I did make rails in the Sangamon Bottom. I don't know whether we made
      those rails or not; fact is, I don't think they are a credit to the
      makers" (laughing as he spoke). "But I do know this: I made rails then,
      and I think I could make better ones than these now."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the innocent Egyptians began to open their eyes: they saw
      plainly enough now the admirable Presidential scheme unfolded to their
      view. The result of it all was a resolution declaring that "Abraham
      Lincoln <i>is the first choice of the Republican party of Illinois for the
      Presidency, and instructing the delegates to the Chicago Convention to use
      all honorable means to secure his nomination, and to cast the vote of the
      State as a unit for him</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd at Decatur, delegates and private citizens, who took part in
      these proceedings, was estimated at five thousand. Neither the numbers nor
      the enthusiasm was a pleasant sight to the divided and demoralized
      Democrats. They disliked to hear so much about "honest Old Abe," "the
      rail-splitter," "the flat-boatman," "the pioneer." These cries had an
      ominous sound in their ears. Leaving Decatur on the cars, an old man out
      of Egypt, devoted to the great principles of Democracy, and excessively
      annoyed by the demonstration in progress, approached Mr. Lincoln and said,
      "So you're Abe Lincoln?"&mdash;"That's my name, sir," answered Mr.
      Lincoln. "They say you're a self-made man," said the Democrat. "Well,
      yes," said Mr. Lincoln, "what there is of me is self-made."&mdash;"Well,
      all I've got to say," observed the old man, after a careful survey of the
      statesman before him, "is, that it was a d&mdash;n bad job."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Mr. Lincoln's claims had been attractively presented to
      the politicians of other States. So early as 1858, Mr. Herndon had been to
      Boston partly, if not entirely, on this mission; and latterly Judge Davis,
      Leonard Swett, and others had visited Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and
      Maryland in his behalf. Illinois was, of course, overwhelmingly and
      vociferously for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th of May, the Republican Convention assembled at Chicago. The
      city was literally crammed with delegates, alternates, "outside workers,"
      and spectators. No nominating convention had ever before attracted such
      multitudes to the scene of its deliberations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first and second days were spent in securing a permanent organization,
      and the adoption of a platform. The latter set out by reciting the
      Declaration of Independence as to the equality of all men, not forgetting
      the usual quotation about the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of
      happiness." The third resolution denounced disunion in any possible event;
      the fourth declared the right of each State to "order and control its own
      domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively;" the
      fifth denounced the administration and its treatment of Kansas, as well as
      its general support of the supposed rights of the South under the
      Constitution; the sixth favored "economy;" the seventh denied the "new
      dogma, that the Constitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any
      or all of the Territories of the United States;" the eighth denied the
      "authority of Congress, of a Territorial Legislature, or of any
      individuals, to give legal existence to slavery in any Territory of the
      United States;" the ninth called the African slave-trade a "burning
      shame;" the tenth denounced the governors of Kansas and Nebraska for
      vetoing certain antislavery bills; the eleventh favored the admission of
      Kansas; the twelfth was a high-tariff manifesto, and a general stump
      speech to the mechanics; the thirteenth lauded the Homestead policy; the
      fourteenth opposed any Federal or State legislation "by which the rights
      of citizenship, hitherto accorded to immigrants from foreign lands, shall
      be abridged or impaired," with some pretty words, intended as a further
      bid for the foreign vote; the fifteenth declared for "river and harbor
      improvements," and the sixteenth for a "Pacific Railroad." It was a very
      comprehensive "platform;" and, if all classes for whom planks were
      provided should be kind enough to stand upon them, there could be no
      failure in the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day the balloting for a candidate was to begin. Up to the
      evening of the second day, Mr. Seward's prospects were far the best. It
      was certain that he would receive the largest vote on the first ballot;
      and outside of the body itself the "crowd" for him was more numerous and
      boisterous than for any other, except Mr. Lincoln. For Mr. Lincoln,
      however, the "pressure" from the multitude, in the Wigwam, in the streets,
      and in the hotels, was tremendous. It is sufficiently accounted for by the
      fact that the "spot" was Chicago, and the State Illinois. Besides the vast
      numbers who came there voluntarily to urge his claims, and to cheer for
      him, as the exigency demanded, his adherents had industriously "drummed
      up" their forces in the city and country, and were now able to make
      infinitely more noise than all the other parties put together. There was a
      large delegation of roughs there for Mr. Seward, headed by Tom Hyer, the
      pugilist. These, and others like them, filled the Wigwam toward the
      evening of the second day in expectation that the voting would begin. The
      Lincoln party found it out, and determined to call a check to that game.
      They spent the whole night in mustering and organizing their "loose
      fellows" from far and near, and at daylight the next morning "took charge"
      of the Wigwam, filling every available space, and much that they had no
      business to fill. As a result, the Seward men were unable to get in, and
      were forced to content themselves with curbstone enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln seemed to be very sure, all along, that the contest would be
      ultimately between him and Mr. Seward. The "Bates men" were supposed to be
      conservative, that is, not Abolitionists; and the object of the move in
      favor of Mr. Bates was to lower the fanatical tone of the party, and save
      the votes of certain "Union men" who might otherwise be against it. But a
      Seward man had telegraphed to St. Louis, to the friends of Mr. Bates, to
      say that Lincoln was as bad as Seward, and to urge them to go for Mr.
      Seward in case their own favorite should fail. The despatch was printed in
      "The Missouri Democrat," but was not brought to Mr. Lincoln's attention
      until the meeting of the Convention. He immediately caught up the paper,
      and "wrote on its broad margin," "Lincoln agrees with Seward in his
      irrepressible-conflict idea, and in negro equality; but he is opposed to
      Seward's Higher Law." With this he immediately despatched a friend to
      Chicago, who handed it to Judge Davis or Judge Logan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania was nominally a candidate; but, in the
      language of Col. McClure, "it meant nothing:" it was a mere sham, got up
      to enable Cameron to make a bargain with some real candidate, and thus
      secure for himself and his friends the lion's share of the spoils in the
      event of a victory at the polls. The genuine sentiment of the Pennsylvania
      delegation was divided between Judge Bates and Judge McLean. But Cameron
      was in a fine position to trade, and his friends were anxious for
      business. On the evening of the second day, these gentlemen were
      gratified. A deputation of them&mdash;Casey, Sanderson, Reeder, and
      perhaps others&mdash;were invited to the Lincoln Head-quarters at the
      Tremont House, where they were met by Messrs. Davis, Swett, Logan, and
      Dole, on the part of Mr. Lincoln. An agreement was there made, that, if
      the Cameron men would go for Lincoln, and he should be nominated and
      elected, Cameron should have a seat in his Cabinet, <i>provided</i> the
      Pennsylvania delegation could be got to recommend him. The bargain was
      fulfilled, but not without difficulty. Cameron's strength was more
      apparent than real. There was, however, "a certain class of the delegates
      under his immediate influence;" and these, with the aid of Mr. Wilmot and
      his friends, who were honestly for Lincoln, managed to carry the
      delegation by a very small majority,&mdash;"about six."
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time a similar bargain was made with the friends of Caleb
      B. Smith of Indiana; and with these two contracts quietly ratified, the
      Lincoln men felt strong and confident on the morning of the third day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the candidates were being named, and when the ballotings began,
      every mention of Mr. Lincoln's name was received with thundering shouts by
      the vast mass of his adherents by whom the building had been packed. In
      the phrase of the day, the "outside pressure" was all in his favor. On the
      first ballot, Mr. Seward had 173 1/2 votes; Mr. Lincoln, 102; Mr. Cameron,
      50 1/2; Mr. Chase, 49; Mr. Bates, 48; Mr. Dayton, 14; Mr. McLean, 12; Mr.
      Collamer, 10; and 6 were scattered. Mr. Cameron's name was withdrawn on
      the second ballot, according to the previous understanding; Mr. Seward had
      184 1/2; Mr. Lincoln, 181; Mr. Chase, 42 1/2; Mr. Bates, 35; Mr. Dayton,
      10; Mr. McLean, 8; and the rest scattered. It was clear that the
      nomination lay between Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln, and the latter was
      receiving great accessions of strength. The third ballot came, and Mr.
      Lincoln ran rapidly up to 231 1/2 votes; 233 being the number required to
      nominate. Hundreds of persons were keeping the count; and it was well
      known, without any announcement, that Mr. Lincoln lacked but a vote and a
      half to make him the nominee. At this juncture, Mr. Cartter of Ohio rose,
      and changed four votes from Mr. Chase to Mr. Lincoln. He was nominated.
      The Wigwam shook to its foundation with the roaring cheers. The multitude
      in the streets answered the multitude within, and in a moment more all the
      holiday artillery of Chicago helped to swell the grand acclamation. After
      a time, the business of the convention proceeded amid great excitement.
      All the votes that had heretofore been cast against Mr. Lincoln were cast
      for him before this ballot concluded; and, upon motion, the nomination was
      made unanimous. The convention then adjourned for dinner, and in the
      afternoon finished its work by the nomination of Hannibal Hamlin of Maine
      for Vice-President.

      All that day and all the day previous Mr. Lincoln was in Springfield,
      trying to behave as usual, but watching the proceedings of the Convention,
      as they were reported by telegraph, with nervous anxiety. Mr. Baker, the
      friend who had taken "The Missouri Democrat" to Chicago with Mr. Lincoln's
      pregnant indorsement upon it, returned on the night of the 18th. Early in
      the morning, he and Mr. Lincoln went to the balll-alley to play at
      "fives;" but the alley was pre-engaged. They went to an "excellent and
      neat beer saloon" to play a game of billiards; but the table was occupied.
      In this strait they contented themselves with a glass of beer, and
      repaired to "The Journal" office for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. P. Brown says that Lincoln played ball a great deal that day,
      notwithstanding the disappointment when he went with Baker; and Mr. Zane
      informs us that he was engaged in the same way the greater part of the day
      previous. It is probable that he took this physical mode of working off or
      keeping down the unnatural excitement that threatened to possess him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock in the morning, Mr. Lincoln came to the office of
      Lincoln &amp; Herndon. Mr. Zane was then conversing with a student, "Well,
      boys," said Mr. Lincoln, "what do you know?"&mdash;"Mr. Rosette," answered
      Zane, "who came from Chicago this morning, thinks your chances for the
      nomination are good." Mr. Lincoln wished to know what Mr. Rosette's
      opinion was founded upon; and, while Zane was explaining, Mr. Baker
      entered with a telegram, "which said the names of the candidates for
      nomination had been announced," and that Mr. Lincoln's had been received
      with more applause than any other. Mr. Lincoln lay down on a sofa to rest.
      Soon after, Mr. Brown entered; and Mr. Lincoln said to him, "Well, Brown,
      do you know any thing?" Brown did not know much; and so Mr. Lincoln,
      secretly nervous and impatient, rose and exclaimed, "Let's go to the
      telegraph-office." After waiting some time at the office, the result of
      the first ballot came over the wire. It was apparent to all present that
      Mr. Lincoln thought it very favorable. He believed that if Mr. Seward
      failed to get the nomination, or to "come very near it," on the first
      ballot, he would fail altogether. Presently the news of the second ballot
      arrived, and Mr. Lincoln showed by his manner that he considered the
      contest no longer doubtful. "I've got him," said he. He then went over to
      the office of "The Journal," where other friends were awaiting decisive
      intelligence. The local editor of that paper, Mr. Zane, and others,
      remained behind to receive the expected despatch. In due time it came: the
      operator was intensely excited; at first he threw down his pencil, but,
      seizing it again, wrote off the news that threw Springfield into a frenzy
      of delight. The local editor picked it up, and rushed to "The Journal"
      office. Upon entering the room, he called for three cheers for the next
      President. They were given, and then the despatch was read. Mr. Lincoln
      seemed to be calm, but a close observer could detect in his countenance
      the indications of deep emotion. In the mean time cheers for Lincoln
      swelled up from the streets, and began to be heard throughout the town.
      Some one remarked, "Mr. Lincoln, I suppose now we will soon have a book
      containing your life."&mdash;"There is not much," he replied, "in my past
      life about which to write a book, as it seems to me." Having received the
      hearty congratulations of the company in the office, he descended to the
      street, where he was immediately surrounded by "Irish and American
      citizens;" and, so long as he was willing to receive it, there was great
      handshaking and felicitating. "Gentlemen," said the great man with a happy
      twinkle in his eye, "you had better come up and shake my hand while you
      can: honors elevate some men, you know." But he soon bethought him of a
      person who was of more importance to him than all this crowd. Looking
      toward his house, he said, "Well, gentlemen, there is a little short woman
      at our house who is probably more interested in this despatch than I am;
      and, if you will excuse me, I will take it up and let her see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day a hundred guns were fired at Springfield; and in the
      evening a great mass meeting "ratified" the nomination, and, after doing
      so, adjourned to the house of the nominee. Mr. Lincoln appeared, made a
      "model" speech, and invited into his house everybody that could get in. To
      this the immense crowd responded that they would give him a larger house
      the next year, and in the mean time beset the one he had until after
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day the Committee of the Convention, with Mr. Ashmun, the
      president, at its head, arrived at Springfield to notify Mr. Lincoln of
      his nomination. Contrary to what might have been expected, he seemed sad
      and dejected. The re-action from excessive joy to deep despondency&mdash;a
      process peculiar to his constitution&mdash;had already set in. To the
      formal address of the Committee, he responded with admirable taste and
      feeling;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee,&mdash;I tender to you, and
      through you to the Republican National Convention, and all the people
      represented in it, my profoundest thanks for the high honor done me, which
      you now formally announce. Deeply and even painfully sensible of the great
      responsibility which is inseparable from this high honor,&mdash;a
      responsibility which I could almost wish had fallen upon some one of the
      far more eminent men and experienced statesmen whose distinguished names
      were before the Convention, I shall, by your leave, consider more fully
      the resolutions of the Convention, denominated the platform, and, without
      unnecessary and unreasonable delay, respond to you, Mr. Chairman, in
      writing, not doubting that the platform will be found satisfactory, and
      the nomination gratefully accepted. And now I will not longer defer the
      pleasure of taking you, and each of you, by the hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee handed him a letter containing the official notice,
      accompanied by the resolutions of the Convention; and to this he replied
      on the 23d as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Ill, May 23,1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hon. George Ashmun, President of the Republican National Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;I accept the nomination tendered me by the Convention over
      which you presided, and of which I am formally apprised in the letter of
      yourself and others, acting as a Committee of the Convention for that
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your letter
      meets my approval; and it shall be my care not to violate or disregard it
      in any part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with due regard to the
      views and feelings of all who were represented in the Convention; to the
      rights of all the States and Territories, and people of the nation; to the
      inviolability of the Constitution, and the perpetual union, harmony, and
      prosperity of all,&mdash;I am most happy to co-operate for the practical
      success of the principles declared by the Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your obliged friend and fellow-citizen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the National Democratic Convention had met at Charleston,
      S.C., and split in twain. The South utterly repudiated Mr. Douglas's new
      heresy; and Mr. Douglas insisted that the whole party ought to become
      heretics with him, and, turning their backs on the Dred-Scott Decision and
      the Cincinnati Platform, give up slavery in the Territories to the tender
      mercies of "squatter sovereignty" and "unfriendly legislation." Neither
      party to the controversy would be satisfied with a simple re-affirmation
      of the Cincinnati Platform; for under it Mr. Douglas could go to the North
      and say that it meant "squatter sovereignty," and Mr. Breckinridge could
      go to the South and say that it meant Congressional protection to slavery.
      In fact, it meant neither, and said neither, but declared, in plain
      English words, that Congress had no power to interfere with slavery in the
      Territories; and that, when the Territories were about to become States,
      they had all power to settle the question for themselves. Gen. B. F.
      Butler of Massachusetts proposed to heal the ominous divisions in the
      Convention by the re-adoption of that clear and emphatic provision; but
      his voice was soon drowned in the clamors of the fiercer disputants. The
      differences were irreconcilable. Mr. Douglas's friends had come there
      determined to nominate him at any cost; and, in order to nominate him,
      they dared not concede the platform to the South. A majority of the
      Committee on Resolutions reported the Cincinnati Platform, with the
      Southern interpretation of it; and the minority reported the same platform
      with a recitation concerning the "differences of opinion" "in the
      Democratic party," and a pledge to abide by the decision of the Supreme
      Court "on the questions of constitutional law,"&mdash;a pledge supposed to
      be of little value, since those who gave it were that moment in the very
      act of repudiating the only decision the Court had ever rendered. The
      minority report was adopted after a protracted and acrimonious debate, by
      a vote of one hundred and sixty-five to one hundred and thirty-eight.
      Thereupon the Southern delegates, most of them under instructions from
      their State conventions, withdrew, and organized themselves into a
      separate convention. The remaining delegates, called "the rump" by their
      Democratic adversaries, proceeded to ballot for a candidate for President,
      and voted fifty-seven times without effecting a nomination. Mr. Douglas,
      of course, received the highest number of votes; but, the old two-thirds
      rule being in force, he failed of a nomination. Mr. Guthrie of Kentucky
      was his principal competitor; but at one time and another Mr. Hunter of
      Virginia, Gen. Lane of Oregon, and Mr. Johnson of Tennessee, received
      flattering and creditable votes. After the fifty-seventh ballot, the
      Convention adjourned to meet at Baltimore on the 18th of June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seceders met in another hall, adopted the majority platform, as the
      adhering delegates had adopted the minority platform, and then adjourned
      to meet at Richmond on the second Monday in June. Faint hopes of
      accommodation were still entertained; and, when the seceders met at
      Richmond, they adjourned again to Baltimore, and the 28th of June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Douglas Convention, assuming to be the regular one, had invited the
      Southern States to fill up the vacant seats which belonged to them; but,
      when the new delegates appeared, they were met with the apprehension that
      their votes might not be perfectly secure for Mr. Douglas, and were
      therefore, in many instances, lawlessly excluded. This was the signal for
      another secession: the Border States withdrew; Mr. Butler and the
      Massachusetts delegation withdrew; Mr. Cushing deserted the chair, and
      took that of the rival Convention. The "regular" Convention, it was said,
      was now "the rump of a rump."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first ballot for a candidate, Mr. Douglas had 173 1/2 votes; Mr.
      Guthrie, 10; Mr. Breckinridge, 5; and 3 were scattered. On the second
      ballot, Mr. Douglas had 181 1/2; Mr. Breckinridge, 5; and Mr. Guthrie, 5
      1/2. It was plain that under the two-thirds rule no nomination could be
      made here. Neither Mr. Douglas nor any one else could receive two-thirds
      of a full convention. It was therefore resolved that Mr. Douglas, "having
      received two-thirds of all the votes <i>given in this Convention</i>,"
      should be declared the nominee. Mr. Fitzpatrick of Alabama was nominated
      for Vice-President, but declined to stand; and Mr. Johnson of Georgia was
      substituted for him by the Douglas "National Committee."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the seceders' Convention, twenty-one States were represented more or
      less fully. It had no trouble in selecting a candidate. John C.
      Breckinridge of Kentucky and Joseph Lane of Oregon were unanimously
      nominated for the offices of President and Vice-President.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time another party&mdash;the "Constitutional Union party"&mdash;had
      met in Baltimore on the 19th of May, and nominated John Bell of Tennessee
      for President, and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice-President. Its
      platform was, in brief, "The Constitution of the Country, the Union of the
      States, and the Enforcement of the Laws." This body was composed for the
      most part of impenitent Know-Nothings and respectable old-line Whigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring elections had given the democracy good reason to hope for
      success in the fall. The commercial classes, the shipping classes, and
      large numbers of the manufacturers, were thoroughly alarmed for the safety
      of the great trade dependent upon a political connection with the South.
      It seemed probable that a great re-action against antislavery agitations
      might take place. But the division at Charleston, the permanent
      organization of the two factions at Baltimore, and their mutual and
      rancorous hostility, completely reversed the delusive prospect. A majority
      of the whole people of the Union looked forward to a Republican victory
      with dread, and a large part with actual terror; and yet it was now clear
      that that majority was fatally bent upon wasting its power in the bitter
      struggles of the factions which composed it. Mr. Lincoln's election was
      assured; and for them there was nothing left but to put the house in order
      for the great convulsion which all our political fathers and prophets had
      predicted as the necessary consequence of such an event.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th of November, Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the
      United States. He received 1,857,610 votes; Mr. Douglas had 1,291,574; Mr.
      Breckinridge, 850,082; Mr. Bell, 646,124. Against Mr. Lincoln there was a
      majority of 980,170 of all the votes cast. Of the electoral votes, Mr.
      Lincoln had 180; Mr. Breckinridge, 72; Mr. Bell, 30; and Mr. Douglas, 12.
      It is more than likely that Mr. Lincoln owed this, his crowning triumph,
      to the skill and adroitness with which he questioned Mr. Douglas in the
      canvass of 1858, and drew out of him those fatal opinions about "squatter
      sovereignty" and "unfriendly legislation" in the Territories. But for Mr.
      Douglas's committal to those opinions, it is not likely that. Mr. Lincoln
      would ever have been President.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election over, Mr. Lincoln was sorely beset by office-seekers.
      Individuals, deputations, "delegations," from all quarters, pressed in
      upon him in a manner that might have killed a man of less robust
      constitution. The hotels of Springfield were filled with gentlemen who
      came with, light baggage and heavy schemes. The party had never been in
      office: a "clean sweep" of the "ins" was expected; and all the "outs" were
      patriotically anxious to take the vacant places. It was a party that had
      never fed; and it was voraciously hungry. Mr. Lincoln and Artemus Ward saw
      a great deal of fun in it; and in all human probability it was the fun
      alone that enabled Mr. Lincoln to bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Davis says that Mr. Lincoln had determined to appoint "Democrats and
      Republicans alike to office." Many things confirm this statement. Mr.
      Lincoln felt deeply the responsibility of his great trust; and he felt
      still more keenly the supposed impossibility of administering the
      government for the sole benefit of an organization which had no existence
      in one-half of the Union. He was therefore willing, not only to appoint
      Democrats to office, but to appoint them to the very highest offices
      within his gift. At this time he thought very highly of Mr. Stephens of
      Georgia, and would gladly have taken him into his Cabinet but for the fear
      that Georgia might secede, and take Mr. Stephens along with her. He did
      actually authorize his friend, Mr. Speed, to offer the Treasury Department
      to Mr. Guthrie of Kentucky; and Mr. Guthrie, for good reasons of his own,
      declined it. The full significance of this act of courageous magnanimity
      cannot be understood without reference to the proceedings of the
      Charleston Convention, where Mr. Guthrie was one of the foremost
      candidates. He considered the names of various other gentlemen from the
      Border States, each of them with good proslavery antecedents. He
      commissioned Thurlow Weed to place a seat in the Cabinet at the disposal
      of Mr. Gilmore of North Carolina; but Mr. Gilmore, finding that his State
      was likely to secede, was reluctantly compelled to decline it. He was, in
      fact, sincerely and profoundly anxious that the South should be honestly
      represented in his councils by men who had an abiding-place in the hearts
      of her people. To accomplish that high purpose, he was forced to go beyond
      the ranks of his own party; and he had the manliness to do it. He felt
      that his strength lay in conciliation at the outset: that was his ruling
      conviction during all those months of preparation for the great task
      before him. It showed itself, not only in the appointments which he sought
      to make, but in those which he did make. Harboring no jealousies,
      entertaining no fears concerning his personal interests in the future, he
      called around him the most powerful of his late rivals,&mdash;Seward,
      Chase, Bates,&mdash;and unhesitatingly gave into their hands powers which
      most presidents would have shrunk from committing to their equals, and
      much more to their superiors in the conduct of public affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cases of Cameron and Smith, however, were very distressing. He had
      authorized no one to make such bargains for him as had been made with the
      friends of these men. He would gladly have repudiated the contracts, if it
      could have been done with honor and safety. For Smith he had great regard,
      and believed that he had rendered important services in the late
      elections. But his character was now grossly assailed; and it would have
      saved Mr. Lincoln serious embarrassments if he had been able to put him
      aside altogether, and select Mr. Lane or some other Indiana statesman in
      his place. He wavered long, but finally made up his mind to keep the
      pledge of his friends; and Smith was appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cameron's case the contest was fierce and more protracted. At Chicago,
      Cameron's agents had demanded that he should have the Treasury Department;
      but that was too much; and the friends of Mr. Lincoln, tried, pushed, and
      anxious as they were, declined to consider it. They would say that he
      should be appointed to a Cabinet position, but no more; and to secure
      this, he must get a majority of the Pennsylvania delegation to recommend
      him. Mr. Cameron was disposed to exact the penalty of his bond, hard as
      compliance might be on the part of Mr. Lincoln. But Cameron had many and
      formidable enemies, who alleged that he was a man notorious for his evil
      deeds, shameless in his rapacity and corruption, and even more shameless
      in his mean ambition to occupy exalted stations, for which he was utterly
      and hopelessly incompetent; that he had never dared to offer himself as a
      candidate before the people of Pennsylvania, but had more than once gotten
      high offices from the Legislature by the worst means ever used by a
      politician; and that it would be a disgrace, a shame, a standing offence
      to the country, if Mr. Lincoln should consent to put him into his Cabinet.
      On the other hand, Mr. Cameron had no lack of devoted friends to deny
      these charges, and to say that his was as "white a soul" as ever yearned
      for political preferment: they came out to Springfield in numbers,&mdash;Edgar
      Cowan, J. K. Moorehead, Alexander Cummins, Mr. Sanderson, Mr. Casey, and
      many others, besides Gen. Cameron himself. On the ground, of course, were
      the powerful gentlemen who had made the original contract on the part of
      Mr. Lincoln, and who, from first to last, strenuously insisted upon its
      fulfilment. It required a hard struggle to overcome Mr. Lincoln's
      scruples; and the whole force was necessarily mustered in order to
      accomplish it. "All that I am in the world," said he,&mdash;"the
      Presidency and all else,&mdash;I owe to that opinion of me which the
      people express when they call me 'honest Old Abe.' Now, what will they
      think of their <i>honest</i> Abe, when he appoints Simon Cameron to be his
      familiar adviser?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pennsylvania it was supposed for a while that Cameron's audacity had
      failed him, and that he would abandon the attempt. But about the 1st of
      January Mr. Swett, one of the contracting parties, appeared at Harrisburg,
      and immediately afterwards Cameron and some of his friends took flight to
      Springfield. This circumstance put the vigilant opposition on the alert,
      and aroused them to a clear sense of the impending calamity. The sequel is
      a painful story; and it is, perhaps, better to give it in the words of a
      distinguished actor,&mdash;Col. Alexander K. McClure. "I do not know,"
      says he, "that any went there to oppose the appointment but myself. When I
      learned that Cameron had started to Springfield, and that his visit
      related to the Cabinet, I at once telegraphed Lincoln that such an
      appointment would be most unfortunate. Until that time, no one outside a
      small circle of Cameron's friends dreamed of Lincoln's calling him to the
      Cabinet. Lincoln's character for honesty was considered a complete
      guaranty against such a suicidal act. No efforts had therefore been made
      to guard against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In reply to my telegram, Mr. Lincoln answered, requesting me to come to
      Springfield at once. I hastily got letters from Gov. Curtin, Secretary
      Slifer, Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Stevens, and started. I took no
      affidavits with me, nor were any specific charges made against him by me,
      or by any of the letters I bore; but they all sustained me in the
      allegation, that the appointment would disgrace the administration and the
      country, because of the notorious incompetency and public and private
      villany of the candidate. I spent four hours with Mr. Lincoln alone; and
      the matter was discussed very fully and frankly. Although he had
      previously decided to appoint Cameron, he closed our interview by a
      reconsideration of his purpose, and the assurance that within twenty-four
      hours he would write me definitely on the subject. He wrote me, as he
      promised, and stated, that, if I would make specific charges against Mr.
      Cameron, and produce the proof, he would dismiss the subject. I answered,
      declining to do so for reasons I thought should be obvious to every one. I
      believe that affidavits were sent to him, but I had no hand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Subsequently Cameron regarded his appointment as impossible, and he
      proposed to Stevens to join in pressing him. Stevens wrote me of the fact;
      and I procured strong letters from the State administration in his favor.
      A few days after Stevens wrote me a most bitter letter, saying that
      Cameron had deceived him, and was then attempting to enforce his own
      appointment. The bond was demanded of Lincoln; and that decided the
      matter."1
    </p>
    <p>
      1 As this was one of the few public acts which Mr. Lincoln performed with
      a bad conscience, the reader ought to know the consequences of it; and,
      because it may not be convenient to revert to them in detail at another
      place, we give them here, still retaining the language of the eye-witness,
      Col. McClure:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Cameron the night of the day that Lincoln removed him. We met in
      the room of a mutual friend, and he was very violent against Lincoln for
      removing him without consultation or notice. His denunciation against the
      President was extremely bitter, for attempting, as he said, his 'personal
      as well as his political destruction.' He exhibited the letter, which was
      all in Mr. Lincoln's handwriting, and was literally as follows. I quote
      from carefully-treasured recollection:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Sir,&mdash;I have this day nominated Hon. Edwin M. Stanton to be
      Secretary of War, and you to be Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure there is no material error in my quotation of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cameron's chief complaint was, that he had no knowledge or intimation of
      the change until Chase delivered the letter. We were then, as ever before
      and since, and as we ever shall be, not in political sympathy, but our
      personal relations were ever kind. Had he been entirely collected, he
      would probably not have said and done what I heard and witnessed; but he
      wept like a child, and appealed to me to aid in protecting him against the
      President's attempt at personal degradation, assuring me that under like
      circumstances he would defend me. In my presence the proposition was made
      and determined upon to ask Lincoln to allow a letter of resignation to be
      antedated, and to write a kind acceptance of the same in reply. The effort
      was made, in which Mr. Chase joined, although perhaps ignorant of all the
      circumstances of the case; and it succeeded. The record shows that Mr.
      Cameron voluntarily resigned; while, in point of fact, he was summarily
      removed without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In many subsequent conversations with Mr. Lincoln, he did not attempt to
      conceal the great misfortune of Cameron's appointment and the painful
      necessity of his removal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. LINCOLN.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As a slight relief to the miseries of his high position, and the doleful
      tales of the office-hunters, who assailed him morning, noon, and night,
      Mr. Lincoln ran off to Chicago, where he met with the same annoyances, and
      a splendid reception besides. Here, however, he enjoyed the great
      satisfaction of a long private conference with his old friend Speed; and
      it was then that he authorized him to invite Mr. Guthrie to the Cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he began to think very tenderly of his friends and relatives in
      Coles County, especially of his good stepmother and her daughters. By the
      first of February, he concluded that he could not leave his home to assume
      the vast responsibilities that awaited him without paying them a visit.
      Accordingly, he left Springfield on the first day of that month, and went
      straight to Charleston, where Col. Chapman and family resided. He was
      accompanied by Mr. Marshall, the State Senator from that district, and was
      entertained at his house. The people crowded by hundreds to see him; and
      he was serenaded by "both the string and brass bands of the town, but
      declined making a speech." Early the next morning, he repaired "to his
      cousin, Dennis Hanks;" and our Jolly old friend Dennis had the
      satisfaction of seeing a grand levee under his own roof. It was all very
      pleasant to Mr. Lincoln to see such multitudes of familiar faces smiling
      upon his wonderful successes. But the chief object of his solicitude was
      not here; Mrs. Lincoln lived in the southern part of the county, and he
      was all impatience to see her. As soon, therefore, as he had taken a
      frugal breakfast with Dennis, he and Col. Chapman started off in a
      "two-horse buggy" toward Farmington, where his step-mother was living with
      her daughter, Mrs. Moore. They had much difficulty in crossing "the
      Kickapoo" River, which was running full of ice; but they finally made the
      dangerous passage, and arrived at Farmington in safety. The meeting
      between him and the old lady was of a most affectionate and tender
      character. She fondled him as her own "Abe," and he her as his own mother.
      It was soon arranged that she should return with him to Charleston, so
      that they might enjoy by the way the unrestricted and uninterrupted
      intercourse which they both desired above all things, but which they were
      not likely to have where the people could get at him. Then Mr. Lincoln and
      Col. Chapman drove to the house of John Hall, who lived "on the old
      Lincoln farm," where Abe split the celebrated rails, and fenced in the
      little clearing in 1830. Thence they went to the spot where old Tom
      Lincoln was buried. The grave was unmarked and utterly neglected. Mr.
      Lincoln said he wanted to "have it enclosed, and a suitable tombstone
      erected." He told Col. Chapman to go to a "marble-dealer," ascertain the
      cost of the work proposed, and write him in full. He would then send
      Dennis Hanks the money, and an inscription for the stone; and Dennis would
      do the rest. (Col. Chapman performed his part of the business, but Mr.
      Lincoln noticed it no further; and the grave remains in the same condition
      to this day.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "We then returned," says Col. Chapman, "to Farmington, where we found a
      large crowd of citizens&mdash;nearly all old acquaintances&mdash;waiting
      to see him. His reception was very enthusiastic, and appeared to gratify
      him very much. After taking dinner at his step-sister's (Mrs. Moore), we
      returned to Charleston, his step-mother coming with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our conversation during the trip was mostly concerning family affairs.
      Mr. Lincoln spoke to me on the way down to Farmington of his step-mother
      in the most affectionate manner; said she had been his best friend in the
      world, and that no son could love a mother more than he loved her. He also
      told me of the condition of his father's family at the time he married his
      step-mother, and of the change she made in the family, and of the
      encouragement he (Abe) received from her.... He spoke of his father, and
      related some amusing incidents of the old man; of the bull-dogs' biting
      the old man on his return from New Orleans; of the old man's escape, when
      a boy, from an Indian who was shot by his uncle Mordecai. He spoke of his
      uncle Mordecai as being a man of very great natural gifts, and spoke of
      his step-brother, John
    </p>
    <p>
      D. Johnston, who had died a short time previous, in the most affectionate
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arriving at Charleston on our return from Farmington, we proceeded to my
      residence. Again the house was crowded by persons wishing to see him. The
      crowd finally became so great, that he authorized me to announce that he
      would hold a public reception at the Town Hall that evening at seven
      o'clock; but that, until then, he wished to be left with relations and
      friends. After supper he proceeded to the Town Hall, where large numbers
      from the town and surrounding country, irrespective of party, called to
      see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He left this place Wednesday morning at four o'clock to return to
      Springfield.... Mr. Lincoln appeared to enjoy his visit here remarkably
      well. His reception by his old acquaintances appeared to be very
      gratifying to him. They all appeared so glad to see him, irrespective of
      party, and all appeared so anxious that his administration might be a
      success, and that he might have a pleasant and honorable career as
      President."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting between Mr. Lincoln and his mother was very touching. She
      embraced him with deep emotion, and said she was sure she would never
      behold him again, for she felt that his enemies would assassinate him. He
      replied, "No, no, mamma: they will not do that. Trust in the Lord, and all
      will be well: we will see each other again." Inexpressibly affected by
      this new evidence of her tender attachment and deep concern for his
      safety, he gradually and reluctantly withdrew himself from the arms of the
      only mother he had ever known, feeling still more oppressed by the heavy
      cares which time and events were rapidly augmenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear that Mr. Lincoln would be assassinated was not peculiar to his
      step-mother. It was shared by very many of his neighbors at Springfield;
      and the friendly warnings he received were as numerous as they were silly
      and gratuitous. Every conceivable precaution was suggested. Some thought
      the cars might be thrown from the track; some thought he would be
      surrounded and stabbed in some great crowd; others thought he might be
      shot from a house-top as he rode up Pennsylvania Avenue on inauguration
      day; while others still were sure he would be quietly poisoned long before
      the 4th of March. One gentleman insisted that he ought, in common
      prudence, to take his cook with him from Springfield,&mdash;one from
      "among his own female friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mingled with the thousands who came to see him were many of his old
      New-Salem and Petersburg friends and constituents; and among these was
      Hannah Armstrong, the wife of Jack and the mother of William. Hannah had
      been to see him once or twice before, and had thought there was something
      mysterious in his conduct. He never invited her to his house, or
      introduced her to his wife; and this circumstance led Hannah to suspect
      that "there was something wrong between him and her." On one occasion she
      attempted a sort of surreptitious entrance to his house by the kitchen
      door; but it ended very ludicrously, and poor Hannah was very much
      discouraged. On this occasion she made no effort to get upon an intimate
      footing with his family, but went straight to the State House, where he
      received the common run of strangers. He talked to her as he would have
      done in the days when he ran for the Legislature, and Jack was an
      "influential citizen." Hannah was perfectly charmed, and nearly beside
      herself with pride and pleasure. She, too, was filled with the dread of
      some fatal termination to all his glory. "Well," says she, "I talked to
      him some time, and was about to bid him good-by; had told him that it was
      the last time I should ever see him: something told me that I should never
      see him; they would kill him. He smiled, and said jokingly, 'Hannah, if
      they do kill me, I shall never die another death.' I then bade him
      good-by."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was now but a few weeks until Mr. Lincoln was to become the
      constitutional ruler of one of the great nations of the earth, and to
      begin to expend appropriations, to wield armies, to apportion patronage,
      powers, offices, and honors, such as few sovereigns have ever had at
      command. The eyes of all mankind were bent upon him to see how he would
      solve a problem in statesmanship to which the philosophy of Burke and the
      magnanimity of Wellington might have been unequal. In the midst of a
      political canvass in his own State but a few years before, impressed with
      the gravity of the great issues which then loomed but just above the
      political horizon, he had been the first to announce, amid the objections
      and protestations of his friends and political associates, the great
      truth, that "a house divided against itself cannot stand;" that the
      perpetuity of the Union depended upon its becoming devoted either to the
      interests of freedom or slavery. And now, by a turn of fortune
      unparalleled in history, he had been chosen to preside over the interests
      of the nation; while, as yet unseen to him, the question that perplexed
      the founders of the government, which ever since had been a disturbing
      element in the national life, and had at last arrayed section against
      section, was destined to reach its final settlement through the fierce
      struggle of civil war. In many respects his situation was exceptionally
      trying. He was the first President of the United States elected by a
      strictly sectional vote. The party which elected him, and the parties
      which had been defeated, were inflamed by the heat of the canvass. The
      former, with faith in their principles, and a natural eagerness for the
      prizes now within their reach, were not disposed to compromise their first
      success by any lowering of their standard or any concession to the beaten;
      while many of the latter saw in the success of the triumphant party an
      attack on their most cherished rights, and refused in consequence to abide
      by the result of the contest. To meet so grave an exigency, Mr. Lincoln
      had neither precedents nor experience to guide him, nor could he turn
      elsewhere for greater wisdom than he possessed. The leaders of the new
      party were as yet untried in the great responsibilities which had fallen
      upon him and them. There were men among them who had earned great
      reputation as leaders of an opposition; but their eloquence had been
      expended upon a single subject of national concern. They knew how to
      depict the wrongs of a subject race, and also how to set forth the baleful
      effects of an institution like slavery on national character. But was it
      certain that they were equally able to govern with wisdom and prudence the
      mighty people whose affairs were now given to their keeping?
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the day of his overthrow at Chicago, Mr. Seward had been the
      recognized chief of the party; had, like Mr. Lincoln, taught the existence
      of an irrepressible conflict between the North and the South, and had also
      inculcated the idea of a law higher than the Constitution, which was of
      more binding force than any human enactment, until many of his followers
      had come to regard the Constitution with little respect. It was this
      Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, having sworn to preserve, protect, and
      defend, was to attempt to administer to the satisfaction of the minority
      which had elected him, and which was alone expected to support him. To
      moderate the passions of his own partisans, to conciliate his opponents in
      the North, and divide and weaken his enemies in the South, was a task
      which no mere politician was likely to perform, yet one which none but the
      most expert of politicians and wisest of statesmen was fitted to
      undertake. It required moral as well as intellectual qualities of the
      highest order. William of Orange, with a like duty and similar
      difficulties, was ready at one time and another to give up the effort in
      despair, although aided by "the divinity that hedges round a king." Few
      men believed that Mr. Lincoln possessed a single qualification for his
      great office. His friends had indicated what they considered his chief
      merit, when they insisted that he was a very common, ordinary man, just
      like the rest of "the people,"&mdash;"Old Abe," a rail-splitter and a
      story-teller. They said he was good and honest and well-meaning; but they
      took care not to pretend that he was great. He was thoroughly convinced
      that there was too much truth in this view of his character. He felt
      deeply and keenly his lack of experience in the conduct of public affairs.
      He spoke then and afterwards about the duties of the Presidency with much
      diffidence, and said, with a story about a justice of the peace in
      Illinois, that they constituted his "great first case misunderstood." He
      had never been a ministerial or an executive officer. His most intimate
      friends feared that he possessed no administrative ability; and in this
      opinion he seems to have shared himself, at least in his calmer and more
      melancholy moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having put his house in order, arranged all his private business, made
      over his interest in the practice of Lincoln &amp; Herndon to Mr. Herndon,
      and requested "Billy," as a last favor, to leave his name on the old sign
      for four years at least, Mr. Lincoln was ready for the final departure
      from home and all familiar things. And this period of transition from
      private to public life&mdash;a period of waiting and preparing for the
      vast responsibilities that were to bow down his shoulders during the years
      to come&mdash;affords us a favorable opportunity to turn back and look at
      him again as his neighbors saw him from 1837 to 1861.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was about six feet four inches high,&mdash;the length of his
      legs being out of all proportion to that of his body. When he sat down on
      a chair, he seemed no taller than an average man, measuring from the chair
      to the crown of his head; but his knees rose high in front, and a marble
      placed on the cap of one of them would roll down a steep descent to the
      hip. He weighed about a hundred and eighty pounds; but he was thin through
      the breast, narrow across the shoulders, and had the general appearance of
      a consumptive subject. Standing up, he stooped slightly forward; sitting
      down, he usually crossed his long legs, or threw them over the arms of the
      chair, as the most convenient mode of disposing of them. His "head was
      long, and tall from the base of the brain and the eyebrow;" his forehead
      high and narrow, but inclining backward as it rose. The diameter of his
      head from ear to ear was six and a half inches, and from front to back
      eight inches. The size of his hat was seven and an eighth. His ears were
      large, standing out almost at right-angles from his head; his cheek-bones
      high and prominent; his eyebrows heavy, and jutting forward over small,
      sunken blue eyes; his nose long, large, and blunt, the tip of it rather
      ruddy, and slightly awry toward the right-hand side; his chin, projecting
      far and sharp, curved upward to meet a thick, material, lower lip, which
      hung downward; his cheeks were flabby, and the loose skin fell in
      wrinkles, or folds; there was a large mole on his right cheek, and an
      uncommonly prominent Adam's apple on his throat; his hair was dark brown
      in color, stiff, unkempt, and as yet showing little or no sign of
      advancing age or trouble; his complexion was very dark, his skin yellow,
      shrivelled, and "leathery." In short, to use the language of Mr. Herndon,
      "he was a thin, tall, wiry, sinewy, grizzly, raw-boned man," "looking
      woe-struck." His countenance was haggard and careworn, exhibiting all the
      marks of deep and protracted suffering. Every feature of the man&mdash;the
      hollow eyes, with the dark rings beneath; the long, sallow, cadaverous
      face, intersected by those peculiar deep lines; his whole air; his walk;
      his long, silent reveries, broken at long intervals by sudden and
      startling exclamations, as if to confound an observer who might suspect
      the nature of his thoughts&mdash;showed he was a man of sorrows,&mdash;not
      sorrows of to-day or yesterday, but long-treasured and deep,&mdash;bearing
      with him a continual sense of weariness and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a plain, homely, sad, weary-looking man, to whom one's heart warmed
      involuntarily, because he seemed at once miserable and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a winter's morning, this man could be seen wending his way to the
      market, with a basket on his arm, and a little boy at his side, whose
      small feet rattled and pattered over the ice-bound pavement, attempting to
      make up by the number of his short steps for the long strides of his
      father. The little fellow jerked at the bony hand which held his, and
      prattled and questioned, begged and grew petulant, in a vain effort to
      make his father talk to him. But the latter was probably unconscious of
      the other's existence, and stalked on, absorbed in his own reflections. He
      wore on such occasions an old gray shawl, rolled into a coil, and wrapped
      like a rope around his neck. The rest of his clothes were in keeping. "He
      did not walk cunningly,&mdash;Indian-like,&mdash;but cautiously and
      firmly." His tread was even and strong. He was a little pigeon-toed; and
      this, with another peculiarity, made his walk very singular. He set his
      whole foot flat on the ground, and in turn lifted it all at once,&mdash;not
      resting momentarily upon the toe as the foot rose, nor upon the heel as it
      fell. He never wore his shoes out at the heel and the toe more, as most
      men do, than at the middle of the sole; yet his gait was not altogether
      awkward, and there was manifest physical power in his step. As he moved
      along thus silent, abstracted, his thoughts dimly reflected in his sharp
      face, men turned to look after him as an object of sympathy as well as
      curiosity: "his melancholy," in the words of Mr. Herndon, "dripped from
      him as he walked." If, however, he met a friend in the street, and was
      roused by a loud, hearty "Good-morning, Lincoln!" he would grasp the
      friend's hand with one or both of his own, and, with his usual expression
      of "Howdy, howdy," would detain him to hear a story: something reminded
      him of it; it happened in Indiana, and it must be told, for it was
      wonderfully pertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his breakfast-hour, he would appear at his office, and go about the
      labors of the day with all his might, displaying prodigious industry and
      capacity for continuous application, although he never was a fast worker.
      Sometimes it happened that he came without his breakfast; and then he
      would have in his hands a piece of cheese, or Bologna sausage, and a few
      crackers, bought by the way. At such times he did not speak to his partner
      or his friends, if any happened to be present: the tears were, perhaps,
      struggling into his eyes, while his pride was struggling to keep them
      back. Mr. Herndon knew the whole story at a glance: there was no speech
      between them; but neither wished the visitors to the office to witness the
      scene; and, therefore, Mr. Lincoln retired to the back office, while Mr.
      Herndon locked the front one, and walked away with the key in his pocket.
      In an hour or more the latter would return, and perhaps find Mr. Lincoln
      calm and collected; otherwise he went out again, and waited until he was
      so. Then the office was opened, and every thing went on as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Lincoln had a speech to write, which happened very often, he
      would put down each thought, as it struck him, on a small strip of paper,
      and, having accumulated a number of these, generally carried them in his
      hat or his pockets until he had the whole speech composed in this odd way,
      when he would sit down at his table, connect the fragments, and then write
      out the whole speech on consecutive sheets in a plain, legible
      handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      His house was an ordinary two-story frame-building, with a stable and a
      yard: it was a bare, cheerless sort of a place. He planted no fruit or
      shade trees, no shrubbery or flowers. He did on one occasion set out a few
      rose-bushes in front of his house; but they speedily perished, or became
      unsightly for want of attention. Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Lincoln's sister,
      undertook "to hide the nakedness" of the place by planting some flowers;
      but they soon withered and died. He cultivated a small garden for a single
      year, working in it himself; but it did not seem to prosper, and that
      enterprise also was abandoned. He had a horse and a cow: the one was fed
      and curried, and the other fed and milked, by his own hand. When at home,
      he chopped and sawed all the wood that was used in his house. Late one
      night he returned home, after an absence of a week or so. His neighbor,
      Webber, was in bed; but, hearing an axe in use at that unusual hour, he
      rose to see what it meant. The moon was high; and by its light he looked
      down into Lincoln's yard, and there saw him in his shirt-sleeves "cutting
      wood to cook his supper with." Webber turned to his watch, and saw that it
      was one o'clock. Besides this house and lot, and a small sum of money, Mr.
      Lincoln had no property, except some wild land in Iowa, entered for him
      under warrants, received for his service in the Black Hawk War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wallace thinks "Mr. Lincoln was a domestic man by nature." He was not
      fond of other people's children, but was extremely fond of his own: he was
      patient, indulgent, and generous with them to a fault. On Sundays he often
      took those that were large enough, and walked with them into the country,
      and, giving himself up entirely to them, rambled through the green fields
      or the cool woods, amusing and instructing them for a whole day at a time.
      His method of reading is thus quaintly described. "He would read,
      generally aloud (couldn't read otherwise),&mdash;would read with great
      warmth, all funny or humorous things; read Shakspeare that way. He was a
      sad man, an abstracted man. He would lean back, his head against the top
      of a rocking-chair; sit abstracted that way for minutes,&mdash;twenty,
      thirty minutes,&mdash;and all at once would burst out into a joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Col. Chapman, daughter of Dennis Hanks, and therefore a relative of
      Mr. Lincoln, made him a long visit previous to her marriage. "You ask me,"
      says she, "how Mr. Lincoln acted at home. I can say, and that truly, he
      was all that a husband, father, and neighbor should be,&mdash;kind and
      affectionate to his wife and child ('Bob' being the only one they had when
      I was with them), and very pleasant to all around him. Never did I hear
      him utter an unkind word. For instance: one day he undertook to correct
      his child, and his wife was determined that he should not, and attempted
      to take it from him; but in this she failed. She then tried
      tongue-lashing, but met with the same fate; for Mr. Lincoln corrected his
      child as a father ought to do, in the face of his wife's anger, and that,
      too, without even changing his countenance or making any reply to his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His favorite way of reading, when at home, was lying down on the floor. I
      fancy I see him now, lying full-length in the hall of his old house
      reading. When not engaged reading law-books, he would read literary works,
      and was very fond of reading poetry, and often, when he would be, or
      appear to be, in deep study, commence and repeat aloud some piece that he
      had taken a fancy to, such as the one you already have in print, and 'The
      Burial of Sir John Moore,' and so on. He often told laughable jokes and
      stories when he thought we were looking gloomy."

    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was not supremely happy in his domestic relations: the
      circumstances of his courtship and marriage alone made that impossible.
      His engagement to Miss Todd was one of the great misfortunes of his life
      and of hers. He realized the mistake too late; and when he was brought
      face to face with the lie he was about to enact, and the wrong he was
      about to do, both to himself and an innocent woman, he recoiled with
      horror and remorse. For weeks together, he was sick, deranged, and on the
      verge of suicide,&mdash;a heavy care to his friends, and a source of
      bitter mortification to the unfortunate lady, whose good fame depended, in
      a great part, upon his constancy. The wedding garments and the marriage
      feast were prepared, the very hour had come when the solemn ceremony was
      to be performed; and the groom failed to appear! He was no longer a free
      agent: he was restrained, carefully guarded, and soon after removed to a
      distant place, where the exciting causes of his disease would be less
      constant and active in their operation. He recovered slowly, and at length
      returned to Springfield. He spoke out his feelings frankly and truly to
      the one person most interested in them. But he had been, from the
      beginning, except in the case of Ann Rutledge, singularly inconstant and
      unstable in his relations with the few refined and cultivated women who
      had been the objects of his attention. He loved Miss Rutledge
      passionately, and the next year importuned Miss Owens to be his wife.
      Failing in his suit, he wrote an unfeeling letter about her, apparently
      with no earthly object but to display his levity and make them both
      ridiculous. He courted Miss Todd, and at the moment of success fell in
      love with her relative, and, between the two, went crazy, and thought of
      ending all his woes with a razor or a pocket-knife. It is not impossible
      that the feelings of such a man might have undergone another and more
      sudden change. Perhaps they did. At all events, he was conscientious and
      honorable and just. There was but one way of repairing the injury he had
      done Miss Todd, and he adopted it. They were married; but they understood
      each other, and suffered the inevitable consequences, as other people do
      under similar circumstances. But such troubles seldom fail to find a
      tongue; and it is not strange, that, in this case, neighbors and friends,
      and ultimately the whole country, came to know the state of things in that
      house. Mr. Lincoln scarcely attempted to conceal it, but talked of it with
      little or no reserve to his wife's relatives, as well as his own friends.
      Yet the gentleness and patience with which he bore this affliction from
      day to day, and from year to year, was enough to move the shade of
      Socrates. It touched his acquaintances deeply, and they gave it the widest
      publicity. They made no pause to inquire, to investigate, and to apportion
      the blame between the parties, according to their deserts. Almost ever
      since Mr. Lincoln's death, a portion of the press has never tired of
      heaping brutal reproaches upon his wife and widow; whilst a certain class
      of his friends thought they were honoring his memory by multiplying
      outrages and indignities upon her, at the very moment when she was broken
      by want and sorrow, defamed, defenceless, in the hands of thieves, and at
      the mercy of spies. If ever a woman grievously expiated an offence not her
      own, this woman did. In the Herndon manuscripts, there is a mass of
      particulars under this head; but Mr. Herndon sums them all up in a single
      sentence, in a letter to one of Mr. Lincoln's biographers: "All that I
      know ennobles both."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be very difficult to recite all the causes of Mr. Lincoln's
      melancholy disposition. That it was partly owing to physical causes there
      can be no doubt. Mr. Stuart says, that in some respects he was totally
      unlike other people, and was, in fact, a "mystery." Blue-pills were the
      medicinal remedy which he affected most. But whatever the history or the
      cause,&mdash;whether physical reasons, the absence of domestic concord, a
      series of painful recollections of his mother, of his father and master,
      of early sorrows, blows, and hardships, of Ann Rutledge and fruitless
      hopes, or all these combined, Mr. Lincoln was the saddest and gloomiest
      man of his time. "I do not think that he knew what happiness was for
      twenty years," says Mr. Herndon. "Terrible" is the word which all his
      friends use to describe him in the black mood. "It was terrible! It was
      terrible!" says one and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was filled with gloomy forebodings and strong apprehensions of
      impending evil, mingled with extravagant visions of personal grandeur and
      power. His imagination painted a scene just beyond the veil of the
      immediate future, gilded with glory yet tarnished with blood. It was his
      "destiny,"&mdash;splendid but dreadful, fascinating but terrible. His case
      bore little resemblance to those of religious enthusiasts like Bunyan,
      Cowper, and others. His was more like the delusion of the fatalist,
      conscious of his star. At all events, he never doubted for a moment but
      that he was formed for "some great or miserable end." He talked about it
      frequently and sometimes calmly. Mr. Herndon remembers many of these
      conversations in their office at Springfield, and in their rides around
      the circuit. Mr. Lincoln said the impression had grown in him "all his
      life;" but Mr. Herndon thinks it was about 1840 that it took the character
      of a "religious conviction." He had then suffered much, and, considering
      his opportunities, achieved great things. He was already a leader among
      men, and a most brilliant career had been promised him by the prophetic
      enthusiasm of many friends. Thus encouraged and stimulated, and feeling
      himself growing gradually stronger and stronger, in the estimation of "the
      plain people," whose voice was more potent than all the Warwicks, his
      ambition painted the rainbow of glory in the sky, while his morbid
      melancholy supplied the clouds that were to overcast and obliterate it
      with the wrath and ruin of the tempest. To him it was fate, and there was
      no escape or defence. The presentiment never deserted him: it was as
      clear, as perfect, as certain, as any image conveyed by the senses. He had
      now entertained it so long, that it was as much a part of his nature as
      the consciousness of identity. All doubts had faded away, and he submitted
      humbly to a power which he could neither comprehend nor resist. He was to
      fall,&mdash;fall from a lofty place, and in the performance of a great
      work. The star under which he was born was at once brilliant and
      malignant: the horoscope was cast, fixed, irreversible; and he had no more
      power to alter or defeat it in the minutest particular than he had to
      reverse the law of gravitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the election, he conceived that he would not "last" through his term
      of office, but had at length reached the point where the sacrifice would
      take place. All precautions against assassination he considered worse than
      useless. "If they want to kill me," said he, "there is nothing to
      prevent." He complained to Mr. Gillespie of the small body-guard which his
      counsellors had forced upon him, insisting that they were a needless
      encumbrance. When Mr. Gillespie urged the ease and impunity with which he
      might be killed, and the value of his life to the country, he said, "What
      is the use of putting up the <i>gap</i> when the fence is down all
      around?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was just after my election in 1860," said Mr. Lincoln to his
      secretary, John Hay, "when the news had been coming in thick and fast all
      day, and there had been a great 'hurrah boys!' so that I was well tired
      out, and went home to rest, throwing myself upon a lounge in my chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Opposite to where I lay was a bureau with a swinging glass upon it; and,
      in looking in that glass, I saw myself reflected nearly at full length;
      but my face, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images, the tip of
      the nose of one being about three inches from the tip of the other. I was
      a little bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and looked in the glass;
      but the illusion vanished. On lying down again, I saw it a second time,&mdash;plainer,
      if possible, than before; and then I noticed that one of the faces was a
      little paler&mdash;say five shades&mdash;than the other. I got up, and the
      thing melted away; and I went off, and in the excitement of the hour
      forgot all about it,&mdash;nearly, but not quite, for the thing would once
      in a while come up, and give me a little pang, as though something
      uncomfortable had happened. When I went home, I told my wife about it: and
      a few days after I tried the experiment again, when, sure enough, the
      thing came back again; but I never succeeded in bringing the ghost back
      after that, though I once tried very industriously to show it to my wife,
      who was worried about it somewhat. She thought it was 'a sign' that I was
      to be elected to a second term of office, and that the paleness of one of
      the faces was an omen that I should not see life through the last term."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this morbid and dreamy state of mind, Mr. Lincoln passed the greater
      part of his life. But his "sadness, despair, gloom," Mr. Herndon says,
      "were not of the kind that leads a badly-balanced mind into misanthropy
      and universal hate and scorn. His humor would assert itself from the hell
      of misanthropy: it would assert its independence every third hour or day
      or week. His abstractedness, his continuity of thought, his despair, made
      him, twice in his life, for two weeks at a time, walk that narrow line
      that divides sanity from insanity.... This peculiarity of his nature, his
      humor, his wit, kept him alive in his mind.... It was those good sides of
      his nature that made, to him, his life bearable. Mr. Lincoln was a weak
      man and a strong man by turns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Mr. Lincoln's literary tastes indicated strongly his prevailing
      gloominess of mind. He read Byron extensively, especially "Childe Harold,"
      "The Dream," and "Don Juan." Burns was one of his earliest favorites,
      although there is no evidence that he appreciated highly the best efforts
      of Burns. On the contrary, "Holy Willie's Prayer" was the only one of his
      poems which Mr. Lincoln took the trouble to memorize. He was fond of
      Shakspeare, especially "King Lear," and "The Merry Wives of Windsor." But
      whatever was suggestive of death, the grave, the sorrows of man's days on
      earth, charmed his disconsolate spirit, and captivated his sympathetic
      heart. Solemn-sounding rhymes, with no merit but the sad music of their
      numbers, were more enchanting to him than the loftiest songs of the
      masters. Of these were, "Why should the Spirit of Mortal be Proud?" and a
      pretty commonplace little piece, entitled "The Inquiry." One verse of
      Holmes's "Last Leaf" he thought was "inexpressibly touching." This verse
      we give the reader:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The mossy marbles rest On the lips that he has pressed In their bloom;
        And the names he loved to hear Have been carved for many a year On the
        tomb."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln frequently said that he lived by his humor, and would have
      died without it. His manner of telling a story was irresistibly comical,
      the fun of it dancing in his eyes and playing over every feature. His face
      changed in an instant: the hard lines faded out of it, and the mirth
      seemed to diffuse itself all over him, like a spontaneous tickle. You
      could see it coming long before he opened his mouth, and he began to enjoy
      the "point" before his eager auditors could catch the faintest glimpse of
      it. Telling and hearing ridiculous stories was one of his ruling passions.
      He would go a long way out of his road to tell a grave, sedate fellow a
      broad story, or to propound to him a conundrum that was not particularly
      remarkable for its delicacy. If he happened to hear of a man who was known
      to have something fresh in this line, he would hunt him up, and "swap
      jokes" with him. Nobody remembers the time when his fund of anecdotes was
      not apparently inexhaustible. It was so in Indiana; it was so in New
      Salem, in the Black-Hawk War, in the Legislature, in Congress, on the
      circuit, on the stump,&mdash;everywhere. The most trifling incident
      "reminded" him of a story, and that story reminded him of another, until
      everybody marvelled "that one small head could carry all he knew." The
      "good things" he said were repeated at second-hand, all over the counties
      through which he chanced to travel; and many, of a questionable flavor,
      were attributed to him, not because they were his in fact, but because
      they were like his. Judges, lawyers, jurors, and suitors carried home with
      them select budgets of his stories, to be retailed to itching ears as "Old
      Abe's last." When the court adjourned from village to village, the taverns
      and the groceries left behind were filled with the sorry echoes of his
      "best." He generally located his little narratives with great precision,&mdash;in
      Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois; and if he was not personally "knowing" to the
      facts himself, he was intimately acquainted with a gentleman who was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln used his stories variously,&mdash;to illustrate or convey an
      argument; to make his opinions clear to another, or conceal them
      altogether; to cut off a disagreeable conversation, or to end an
      unprofitable discussion; to cheer his own heart, or simply to amuse his
      friends. But most frequently he had a practical object in view, and
      employed them simply "as labor-saving contrivances."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Judge Davis's opinion, that Mr. Lincoln's hilarity was mainly
      simulated, and that "his stories and jokes were intended to whistle off
      sadness." "The groundwork of his social nature was sad," says Judge Scott;
      "but for the fact that he studiously cultivated the humorous, it would
      have been very sad indeed. His mirth to me always seemed to be put on, and
      did not properly belong there. Like a plant produced in the hot-bed, it
      had an unnatural and luxuriant growth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr. Lincoln's walk among men was remarkably pure, the same cannot
      be said of his conversation. He was endowed by nature with a keen sense of
      humor, and he found great delight in indulging it. But his humor was not
      of a delicate quality; it was chiefly exercised in hearing and telling
      stories of the grosser sort. In this tendency he was restrained by no
      presence and no occasion. It was his opinion that the finest wit and
      humor, the best jokes and anecdotes, emanated from the lower orders of the
      country people. It was from this source that he had acquired his peculiar
      tastes and his store of materials. The associations which began with the
      early days of Dennis Hanks continued through his life at New Salem and his
      career at the Illinois Bar, and did not desert him when, later in life, he
      arrived at the highest dignities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln indulged in no sensual excesses: he ate moderately, and drank
      temperately when he drank at all. For many years he was an ardent agitator
      against the use of intoxicating beverages, and made speeches, far and
      near, in favor of total abstinence. Some of them were printed; and of one
      he was not a little proud. He abstained himself, not so much upon
      principle, as because of a total lack of appetite. He had no taste for
      spirituous liquors; and, when he took them, it was a punishment to him,
      not an indulgence. But he disliked sumptuary laws, and would not prescribe
      by statute what other men should eat or drink. When the temperance men ran
      to the Legislature to invoke the power of the State, his voice&mdash;the
      most eloquent among them&mdash;was silent. He did not oppose them, but
      quietly withdrew from the cause, and left others to manage it. In 1854 he
      was induced to join the order called Sons of Temperance, but never
      attended a single meeting after the one at which he was initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morbid, moody, meditative, thinking much of himself and the things
      pertaining to himself, regarding other men as instruments furnished to his
      hand for the accomplishment of views which he knew were important to him,
      and, therefore, considered important to the public, Mr. Lincoln was a man
      apart from the rest of his kind, unsocial, cold, impassive,&mdash;neither
      a "good hater" nor a fond friend. He unbent in the society of those who
      gave him new ideas, who listened to and admired him, whose attachment
      might be useful, or whose conversation amused him. He seemed to make
      boon-companions of the coarsest men on the list of his acquaintances,&mdash;"low,
      vulgar, unfortunate creatures;" but, as Judge Davis has it, "he used such
      men as tools,&mdash;things to satisfy him, to feed his desires." He felt
      sorry for them, enjoyed them, extracted from them whatever service they
      were capable of rendering, discarded and forgot them. If one of them,
      presuming upon the past, followed him to Washington with a view to
      personal profit, Mr. Lincoln would probably take him to his private room,
      lock the doors, revel in reminiscences of Illinois, new stories and old,
      through an entire evening, and then dismiss his enchanted crony with
      nothing more substantial than his blessing. It was said that "he had no
      heart;" that is, no personal attachments warm and strong enough to govern
      his actions. It was seldom that he praised anybody; and, when he did, it
      was not a rival or an equal in the struggle for popularity and power. His
      encomiums were more likely to be satirical than sincere, and sometimes
      were artfully contrived as mere stratagems to catch the applause he
      pretended to bestow, or at least to share it in equal parts. No one knew
      better how to "damn with faint praise," or to divide the glory of another
      by being the first and frankest to acknowledge it. Fully alive to the fact
      that no qualities of a public man are so charming to the people as
      simplicity and candor, he made simplicity and candor the mask of deep
      feelings carefully concealed, and subtle plans studiously veiled from all
      eyes but one. He had no reverence for great men, followed no leader with
      blind devotion, and yielded no opinion to mere authority. He felt that he
      was as great as anybody, and could do what another did. It was, however,
      the supreme desire of his heart to be right, and to do justice in all the
      relations of life. Although some of his strongest passions conflicted more
      or less directly with this desire, he was conscious of them, and strove to
      regulate them by self-imposed restraints. He was not avaricious, never
      appropriated a cent wrongfully, and did not think money for its own sake a
      fit object of any man's ambition. But he knew its value, its power, and
      liked to keep it when he had it. He gave occasionally to individual
      mendicants, or relieved a case of great destitution at his very door; but
      his alms-giving was neither profuse nor systematic. He never made
      donations to be distributed to the poor who were not of his acquaintance
      and very near at hand. There were few entertainments at his house. People
      were seldom asked to dine with him. To many he seemed inhospitable; and
      there was something about his house, an indescribable air of
      exclusiveness, which forbade the entering guest. It is not meant to be
      said that this came from mere economy. It was not at home that he wished
      to see company. He preferred to meet his friends abroad,&mdash;on a
      street-corner, in an office, at the Court House, or sitting on nail-kegs
      in a country store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln took no part in the promotion of local enterprises, railroads,
      schools, churches, asylums. The benefits he proposed for his fellow-men
      were to be accomplished by political means alone. Politics were his world,&mdash;a
      world filled with hopeful enchantments. Ordinarily he disliked to discuss
      any other subject. "In his office," says Mr. Herndon, "he sat down, or
      spilt himself, on his lounge, read aloud, told stories, talked politics,&mdash;never
      science, art, literature, railroad gatherings, colleges, asylums,
      hospitals, commerce, education, progress, nothing that interested the
      world generally," except politics. He seldom took an active part in local
      or minor elections, or wasted his power to advance a friend. He did
      nothing out of mere gratitude, and forgot the devotion of his warmest
      partisans as soon as the occasion for their services had passed. What they
      did for him was quietly appropriated as the reward of superior merit,
      calling for no return in kind. He was always ready to do battle for a
      principle, after a discreet fashion, but never permitted himself to be
      strongly influenced by the claims of individual men. When he was a
      candidate himself, he thought the whole canvass and all the preliminaries
      ought to be conducted with reference to his success. He would say to a
      man, "Your continuance in the field injures me" and be quite sure that he
      had given a perfect reason for his withdrawal. He would have no
      "obstacles" in his way; coveted honors, was eager for power, and impatient
      of any interference that delayed or obstructed his progress. He worked
      hard enough at general elections, when he could make speeches, have them
      printed, and "fill the speaking trump of fame" with his achievements; but
      in the little affairs about home, where it was all work and no glory, his
      zeal was much less conspicuous. Intensely secretive and cautious, he
      shared his secrets with no man, and revealed just enough of his plans to
      allure support, and not enough to expose their personal application. After
      Speed left, he had no intimates to whom he opened his whole mind. This is
      the unanimous testimony of all who knew him. Feeling himself perfectly
      competent to manage his own affairs, he listened with deceptive patience
      to the views of others, and then dismissed the advice with the adviser.
      Judge Davis was supposed to have great influence over him; but he declares
      that he had literally none. "Once or twice," says he, "he asked my advice
      about the almighty dollar, but never about any thing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his overweening ambition, and the breathless eagerness
      with which he pursued the objects of it, he had not a particle of sympathy
      with the great mass of his fellow-citizens who were engaged in similar
      scrambles for place. "If ever," said he, "American society and the United
      States Government are demoralized and overthrown, it will come from the
      voracious desire of office,&mdash;this wriggle to live without toil, work,
      and labor, from which I am not free myself." Mr. Lincoln was not a
      demagogue or a trimmer. He never deserted a party in disaster, or joined
      one in triumph. Nearly the whole of his public life was spent in the
      service of a party which struggled against hopeless odds, which met with
      many reverses and few victories. It is true, that about the time he began
      as a politician, the Whigs in his immediate locality, at first united with
      the moderate Democrats, and afterwards by themselves, were strong enough
      to help him to the Legislature as often as he chose to go. But, if the
      fact had been otherwise, it is not likely that he would have changed
      sides, or even altered his position in any essential particular, to catch
      the popular favor. Subsequently he suffered many defeats,&mdash;for
      Congress, for Commissioner of the Land Office, and twice for Senator; but
      on this account he never faltered in devotion to the general principles of
      the party, or sought to better his fortune by an alliance with the common
      enemy. It cannot be denied, that, when he was first a candidate for the
      Legislature, his views of public policy were a little cloudy, and that his
      addresses to the people were calculated to make fair weather with men of
      various opinions; nor that, when first a candidate for United States
      Senator, he was willing to make a secret bargain with the extreme
      Abolitionists, and, when last a candidate, to make some sacrifice of
      opinion to further his own aspirations for the Presidency. The pledge to
      Lovejoy and the "House-divided Speech" were made under the influence of
      personal considerations, without reference to the views or the success of
      those who had chosen and trusted him as a leader for a far different
      purpose. But this was merely steering between sections of his own party,
      where the differences were slight and easily reconciled,&mdash;manoeuvring
      for the strength of one faction today and another to-morrow, with intent
      to unite them and lead them to a victory, the benefits of which would
      inure to all. He was not one to be last in the fight and first at the
      feast, nor yet one to be first in the fight and last at the feast. He
      would do his whole duty in the field, but had not the slightest objection
      to sitting down at the head of the table,&mdash;an act which he would
      perform with a modest, homely air, that disarmed envy, and silenced the
      master when he would say, "Friend, go down lower." His "master" was the
      "plain people." To be popular was to him the greatest good in life. He had
      known what it was to be without popularity, and he had known what it was
      to enjoy it. To gain it or to keep it, he considered no labor too great,
      no artifice misused or misapplied. His ambition was strong; yet it existed
      in strict subordination to his sense of party fidelity, and could by no
      chance or possibility lure him into downright social or political
      treasons. His path may have been a little devious, winding hither and
      thither, in search of greater convenience of travel, or the security of a
      larger company; but it always went forward in the same general direction,
      and never ran off at right-angles toward a hostile camp. The great body of
      men who acted with him in the beginning acted with him at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, he was an honest, although a shrewd, and by no means an
      unselfish politician. He
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ................."Foresaw Which way the world began to draw,"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and instinctively drew with it. He had convictions, but preferred to
      choose his time to speak. He was not so much of a Whig that he could not
      receive the support of the "nominal" Jackson men, until party lines were
      drawn so tight that he was compelled to be one thing or the other. He was
      not so much of a Whig that he could not make a small diversion for White
      in 1836, nor so much of a White man that he could not lead Harrison's
      friends in the Legislature during the same winter. He was a firm believer
      in the good policy of high "protective tariffs;" but, when importuned to
      say so in a public letter, he declined on the ground that it would do him
      no good. He detested Know-Nothingism with all his heart; but, when
      Know-Nothingism swept the country, he was so far from being obtrusive with
      his views, that many believed he belonged to the order. He was an
      anti-slavery man from the beginning of his service in the Legislature; but
      he was so cautious and moderate in the expression of his sentiments, that,
      when the anti-Nebraska party disintegrated, the ultra-Republicans were any
      thing but sure of his adherence; and even after the Bloomington Convention
      he continued to pick his way to the front with wary steps, and did not
      take his place among the boldest of the agitators until 1858, when he
      uttered the "House-divided Speech," just in time to take Mr. Seward's
      place on the Presidential ticket of 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any analysis of Mr. Lincoln's character would be defective that did not
      include his religious opinions. On such matters he thought deeply; and his
      opinions were positive. But perhaps no phase of his character has been
      more persistently misrepresented and variously misunderstood, than this of
      his religious belief. Not that the conclusive testimony of many of his
      intimate associates relative to his frequent expressions on such subjects
      has ever been wanting; but his great prominence in the world's history,
      and his identification with some of the great questions of our time,
      which, by their moral import, were held to be eminently religious in their
      character, have led many good people to trace in his motives and actions
      similar convictions to those held by themselves. His extremely general
      expressions of religious faith called forth by the grave exigencies of his
      public life, or indulged in on occasions of private condolence, have too
      often been distorted out of relation to their real significance or meaning
      to suit the opinions or tickle the fancies of individuals or parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was never a member of any church, nor did he believe in the
      divinity of Christ, or the inspiration of the Scriptures in the sense
      understood by evangelical Christians. His theological opinions were
      substantially those expounded by Theodore Parker. Overwhelming testimony
      out of many mouths, and none stronger than that out of his own, place
      these facts beyond controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a boy, he showed no sign of that piety which his many biographers
      ascribe to his manhood. His stepmother&mdash;herself a Christian, and
      longing for the least sign of faith in him&mdash;could remember no
      circumstance that supported her hope. On the contrary, she recollected
      very well that he never went off into a corner, as has been said, to
      ponder the sacred writings, and to wet the page with his tears of
      penitence. He was fond of music; but Dennis Hanks is clear to the point
      that it was songs of a very questionable character that cheered his lonely
      pilgrimage through the woods of Indiana. When he went to church at all, he
      went to mock, and came away to mimic. Indeed, it is more than probable
      that the sort of "religion" which prevailed among the associates of his
      boyhood impressed him with a very poor opinion of the value of the
      article. On the whole, he thought, perhaps, a person had better be without
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to New Salem, he consorted with freethinkers, joined with
      them in deriding the gospel history of Jesus, read Volney and Paine, and
      then wrote a deliberate and labored essay, wherein he reached conclusions
      similar to theirs. The essay was burnt, but he never denied or regretted
      its composition. On the contrary, he made it the subject of free and
      frequent conversations with his friends at Springfield, and stated, with
      much particularity and precision, the origin, arguments, and objects of
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until after Mr. Lincoln's death, that his alleged orthodoxy
      became the principal topic of his eulogists; but since then the effort on
      the part of some political writers and speakers to impress the public mind
      erroneously seems to have been general and systematic. It is important
      that the question should be finally determined; and, in order to do so,
      the names of some of his nearest friends are given below, followed by
      clear and decisive statements, for which they are separately responsible.
      Some of them are gentlemen of distinction, and all of them men of high
      character, who enjoyed the best opportunities to form correct opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      James H. Matheny says in a letter to Mr. Herndon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew Mr. Lincoln as early as 1834-7; know he was an infidel. He and W.
      D. Herndon used to talk infidelity in the clerk's office in this city,
      about the years 1837-40. Lincoln attacked the Bible and the New Testament
      on two grounds: first, from the inherent or apparent contradictions under
      its lids; second, from the grounds of reason. Sometimes he ridiculed the
      Bible and New Testament, sometimes seemed to scoff it, though I shall not
      use that word in its full and literal sense. I never heard that Lincoln
      changed his views, though his personal and political friend from 1834 to
      1860. Sometimes Lincoln bordered on atheism. He went far that way, and
      often shocked me. I was then a young man, and believed what my good mother
      told me. Stuart &amp; Lincoln's office was in what was called Hoffman's
      Row, on North Fifth Street, near the public square. It was in the same
      building as the clerk's office, and on the same floor. Lincoln would come
      into the clerk's office, where I and some young men&mdash;Evan Butler,
      Newton Francis, and others&mdash;were writing or staying, and would bring
      the Bible with him; would read a chapter; argue against it. Lincoln then
      had a smattering of geology, if I recollect it. Lincoln often, if not
      wholly, was an atheist; at least, bordered on it. Lincoln was enthusiastic
      in his infidelity. As he grew older, he grew more discreet, didn't talk
      much before strangers about his religion; but to friends, close and bosom
      ones, he was always open and avowed, fair and honest; but to strangers, he
      held them off from policy. Lincoln used to quote Burns. Burns helped
      Lincoln to be an infidel, as I think; at least, he found in Burns a like
      thinker and feeler. Lincoln quoted 'Tam O'Skanter.' 'What! send one to
      heaven, and ten to hell!' &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From what I know of Mr. Lincoln and his views of Christianity, and from
      what I know as honest and well-founded rumor; from what I have heard his
      best friends say and regret for years; from what he never denied when
      accused, and from what Lincoln has hinted and intimated, to say no more,&mdash;he
      did write a little book on infidelity at or near New Salem, in Menard
      County, about the year 1834 or 1835. I have, stated these things to you
      often. Judge Logan, John T. Stuart, yourself, know what I know, and some
      of you more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Herndon, you insist on knowing something which you know I possess,
      and got as a secret, and that is, about Lincoln's little book on
      infidelity. Mr. Lincoln did tell me that he did write a little book on
      infidelity. This statement I have avoided heretofore; but, as you strongly
      insist upon it,&mdash;probably to defend yourself against charges of
      misrepresentations,&mdash;I give it you as I got it from Lincoln's mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      From Hon. John T. Stuart:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew Mr. Lincoln when he first came here, and for years afterwards. He
      was an avowed and open infidel, sometimes bordered on atheism. I have
      often and often heard Lincoln and one W. D. Herndon, who was a
      freethinker, talk over this subject. Lincoln went further against
      Christian beliefs and doctrines and principles than any man I ever heard:
      he shocked me. I don't remember the exact line of his argument: suppose it
      was against the inherent defects, so called, of the Bible, and on grounds
      of reason. Lincoln always denied that Jesus was the Christ of God,&mdash;denied
      that Jesus was the Son of God, as understood and maintained by the
      Christian Church. The Rev. Dr. Smith, who wrote a letter, tried to convert
      Lincoln from infidelity so late as 1858, and couldn't do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      William H. Herndon, Esq.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to Mr. Lincoln's religious views, he was, in short, an infidel,... a
      theist. He did not believe that Jesus was God, nor the Son of God,&mdash;was
      a fatalist, denied the freedom of the will. Mr. Lincoln told me a thousand
      times, that he did not believe the Bible was the revelation of God, as the
      Christian world contends. The points that Mr. Lincoln tried to demonstrate
      (in his book) were: First, That the Bible was not God's revelation; and,
      Second, That Jesus was not the Son of God. I assert this on my own
      knowledge, and on my veracity. Judge Logan, John T. Stuart, James H.
      Matheny, and others, will tell you the truth. I say they will confirm what
      I say, with this exception,&mdash;they all make it blacker than I remember
      it. Joshua F. Speed of Louisville, I think, will tell you the same thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hon. David Davis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know any thing about Lincoln's religion, and do not think
      anybody knew. The idea that Lincoln talked to a stranger about his
      religion or religious views, or made such speeches, remarks, &amp;c.,
      about it as are published, is to me absurd. I knew the man so well: he was
      the most reticent, secretive man I ever saw, or expect to see. He had no
      faith, in the Christian sense of the term,&mdash;had faith in laws,
      principles, causes, and effects&mdash;philosophically: you [Herndon] know
      more about his religion than any man. You ought to know it, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      William H. Hannah, Esq.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since 1856 Mr. Lincoln told me that he was a kind of immortalist; that he
      never could bring himself to believe in eternal punishment; that man lived
      but a little while here; and that, if eternal punishment were man's doom,
      he should spend that little life in vigilant and ceaseless preparation by
      never-ending prayer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lincoln:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln had no hope and no faith in the usual acceptance of those
      words."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. C. H. Ray:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know how I can aid you. You [Herndon] knew Mr. Lincoln far
      better than I did, though I knew him well; and you have served up his
      leading characteristics in a way that I should despair of doing, if I
      should try. I have only one thing to ask: that you do not give Calvinistic
      theology a chance to claim him as one of its saints and martyrs. He went
      to the Old-School Church; but, in spite of that outward assent to the
      horrible dogmas of the sect, <i>I have reason from, himself</i> to know
      that his 'vital purity' if that means belief in the impossible, was of a
      negative sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      I. W. Keys, Esq.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my intercourse with Mr. Lincoln, I learned that he believed in a
      Creator of all things, who had neither beginning nor end, and possessing
      all power and wisdom, established a principle, in obedience to which
      worlds move, and are upheld, and animal and vegetable life come into
      existence. A reason he gave for his belief was, that, in view of the order
      and harmony of all nature which we behold, it would have been more
      miraculous to have come about by chance than to have been created and
      arranged by some great thinking power. As to the Christian theory, that
      Christ is God, or equal to the Creator, he said that it had better be
      taken for granted; for, by the test of reason, we might become infidels on
      that subject, for evidence of Christ's divinity came to us in a somewhat
      doubtful shape; but that the system of Christianity was an ingenious one
      at least, and perhaps was calculated to do good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jesse W. Fell of Illinois, who had the best opportunities of knowing
      Mr. Lincoln intimately, makes the following statement of his religious
      opinions, derived from repeated conversations with him on the subject:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though every thing relating to the character and history of this
      extraordinary personage is of interest, and should be fairly stated to the
      world, I enter upon the performance of this duty&mdash;for so I regard it&mdash;with
      some reluctance, arising from the fact, that, in stating my convictions on
      the subject, I must necessarily place myself in opposition to quite a
      number who have written on this topic before me, and whose views largely
      pre-occupy the public mind. This latter fact, whilst contributing to my
      embarrassment on this subject, is, perhaps, the strongest reason, however,
      why the truth in this matter should be fully disclosed; and I therefore
      yield to your request. If there were any traits of character that stood
      out in bold relief in the person of Mr. Lincoln, they were those of truth
      and candor. He was utterly incapable of insincerity, or professing views
      on this or any other subject he did not entertain. Knowing such to be his
      true character, that insincerity, much more duplicity, were traits wholly
      foreign to his nature, many of his old friends were not a little surprised
      at finding, in some of the biographies of this great man, statements
      concerning his religious opinions so utterly at variance with his known
      sentiments. True, he may have changed or modified those sentiments after
      his removal from among us, though this is hardly reconcilable with the
      history of the man, and his entire devotion to public matters during his
      four years' residence at the national capital. It is possible, however,
      that this may be the proper solution of this conflict of opinions; or, it
      may be, that, with no intention on the part of any one to mislead the
      public mind, those who have represented him as believing in the popular
      theological views of the times may have misapprehended him, as experience
      shows to be quite common where no special effort has been made to attain
      critical accuracy on a subject of this nature. This is the more probable
      from the well-known fact, that Mr. Lincoln seldom communicated to any one
      his views on this subject. But, be this as it may, I have no hesitation
      whatever in saying, that, whilst he held many opinions in common with the
      great mass of Christian believers, <i>he did not believe</i> in what are
      regarded as the orthodox or evangelical views of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the innate depravity of man, the character and office of the great
      Head of the Church, the atonement, the infallibility of the written
      revelation, the performance of miracles, the nature and design of present
      and future rewards and punishments (as they are popularly called), and
      many other subjects, he held opinions utterly at variance with what are
      usually taught in the Church. I should say that his expressed views on
      these and kindred topics were such as, in the estimation of most
      believers, would place him entirely outside the Christian pale. Yet, to my
      mind, such was not the true position, since his principles and practices
      and the spirit of his whole life were of the very kind we universally
      agree to call Christian; and I think this conclusion is in no wise
      affected by the circumstance that he never attached himself to any
      religious society whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His religious views were eminently practical, and are summed up, as I
      think, in these two propositions: 'the Fatherhood of God, and the
      brotherhood of man.' He fully believed in a superintending and overruling
      Providence, that guides and controls the operations of the world, but
      maintained that law and order, and not their violation or suspension, are
      the appointed means by which this providence is exercised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not attempt any specification of either his belief or disbelief on
      various religious topics, as derived from conversations with him at
      different times during a considerable period; but, as conveying a general
      view of his religious or theological opinions, will state the following
      facts. Some eight or ten years prior to his death, in conversing with him
      upon this subject, the writer took occasion to refer, in terms of
      approbation, to the sermons and writings generally of Dr. W. E. Channing;
      and, finding he was considerably interested in the statement I made of the
      opinions held by that author, I proposed to present him (Lincoln) a copy
      of Channing's entire works, which I soon after did. Subsequently, the
      contents of these volumes, together with the writings of Theodore Parker,
      furnished him, as he informed me, by his friend and law-partner, Mr.
      Herndon, became naturally the topics of conversation with us; and though
      far from believing there was an entire harmony of views on his part with
      either of those authors, yet they were generally much admired and approved
      by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No religious views with him seemed to find any favor, except of the
      practical and rationalistic order; and if, from my recollections on this
      subject, I was called upon to designate an author whose views most nearly
      represented Mr. Lincoln's on this subject, I would say that author was
      Theodore Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you have asked from me a candid statement of my recollections on this
      topic, I have thus briefly given them, with the hope that they may be of
      some service in rightly settling a question about which&mdash;as I have
      good reason to believe&mdash;the public mind has been greatly misled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not doubting that they will accord, substantially, with your own
      recollections, and that of his other intimate and confidential friends,
      and with the popular verdict after this matter shall have been properly
      canvassed, I submit them."
    </p>
    <p>
      John G. Nicolay, his private secretary at the White House:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lincoln did not, to my knowledge, in any way change his religious
      views, opinions, or beliefs, from the time he left Springfield to the day
      of his death. I do not know just what they were, never having heard him
      explain them in detail; but I am very sure he gave no outward indication
      of his mind having undergone any change in that regard while here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter from Mr. Herndon was, about the time of its date,
      extensively published throughout the United States, and met with no
      contradiction from any responsible source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Feb. 18, 1870.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abbott,&mdash;-Some time since I promised you that I would send a
      letter in relation to Mr. Lincoln's religion. I do so now. Before entering
      on that question, one or two preliminary remarks will help us to
      understand why he disagreed with the Christian world in its principles, as
      well as in its theology. In the first place, Mr. Lincoln's mind was a
      purely logical mind; secondly, Mr. Lincoln was purely a practical man. He
      had no fancy or imagination, and not much emotion. He was a realist as
      opposed to an idealist. As a general rule, it is true that a purely
      logical mind has not much hope, if it ever has <i>faith in the unseen and
      unknown</i>. Mr. Lincoln had not much hope and no faith in things that lie
      outside of the domain of demonstration: he was so constituted, so
      organized, that he could believe nothing unless his senses or logic could
      reach it. I have often read to him a law point, a decision, or something I
      fancied: he could not understand it until he took the book out of my hand,
      and read the thing for himself. He was terribly, vexatiously sceptical. He
      could scarcely understand any thing, unless he had time and place fixed in
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became acquainted with Mr. Lincoln in 1834, and I think I knew him well
      to the day of his death. His mind, when a boy in Kentucky, showed a
      certain gloom, an unsocial nature, a peculiar abstractedness, a bold and
      daring scepticism. In Indiana, from 1817 to 1830, it manifested the same
      qualities or attributes as in Kentucky: it only intensified, developed
      itself, along those lines, in Indiana. He came to Illinois in 1830, and,
      after some little roving, settled in New Salem, now in Menard County and
      State of Illinois. This village lies about twenty miles north-west of this
      city. It was here that Mr. Lincoln became acquainted with a class of men
      the world never saw the like of before or since. They were large men,&mdash;large
      in body and large in mind; hard to whip, and never to be fooled. They were
      a bold, daring, and reckless sort of men; they were men of their own
      minds,&mdash;believed what was demonstrable; were men of great common
      sense. With these men Mr. Lincoln was thrown; with them he lived, and with
      them he moved, and almost had his being. They were sceptics all,&mdash;scoffers
      some. These scoffers were good men, and their scoffs were protests against
      theology,&mdash;loud protests against the follies of Christianity: they
      had never heard of theism and the newer and better religious thoughts of
      this age. Hence, being natural sceptics, and being bold, brave men, they
      uttered their thoughts freely: they declared that Jesus was an
      illegitimate child.... They were on all occasions, when opportunity
      offered, debating the various questions of Christianity among themselves:
      they took their stand on common sense and on their own souls; and, though
      their arguments were rude and rough, no man could overthrow their homely
      logic. They riddled all divines, and not unfrequently made them sceptics,&mdash;disbelievers
      as bad as themselves. They were a jovial, healthful, generous, social,
      true, and manly set of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here, and among these people, that Mr. Lincoln was thrown. About
      the year 1834, he chanced to come across Volney's "Ruins," and some of
      Paine's theological works. He at once seized hold of them, and assimilated
      them into his own being. Volney and Paine became a part of Mr. Lincoln
      from 1834 to the end of his life. In 1835 he wrote out a small work on
      "Infidelity," and intended to have it published. The book was an attack
      upon the whole grounds of Christianity, and especially was it an attack
      upon the idea that Jesus was the Christ, the true and only-begotten Son of
      God, as the Christian world contends. Mr. Lincoln was at that time in New
      Salem, keeping store for Mr. Samuel Hill, a merchant and postmaster of
      that place. Lincoln and Hill were very friendly. Hill, I think, was a
      sceptic at that time. Lincoln, one day after the book was finished, read
      it to Mr. Hill, his good friend. Hill tried to persuade him not to make it
      public, not to publish it. Hill at that time saw in Mr. Lincoln a rising
      man, and wished him success. Lincoln refused to destroy it, said it should
      be published. Hill swore it should never see light of day. He had an eye,
      to Lincoln's popularity,&mdash;his present and future success; and
      believing, that if the book were published, it would kill Lincoln forever,
      he snatched it from Lincoln's hand, when Lincoln was not expecting it, and
      ran it into an old-fashioned tin-plate stove, heated as hot as a furnace;
      and so Lincoln's book went up to the clouds in smoke. It is confessed by
      all who heard parts of it, that it was at once able and eloquent; and, if
      I may judge of it from Mr. Lincoln's subsequent ideas and opinions, often
      expressed to me and to others in my presence, it was able, strong, plain,
      and fair. His argument was grounded on the internal mistakes of the Old
      and New Testaments, and on reason, and on the experiences and observations
      of men. The criticisms from internal defects were sharp, strong, and
      manly.

      Mr. Lincoln moved to this city in 1837, and here became acquainted with
      various men of his own way of thinking. At that time they called
      themselves <i>free-thinkers, or free-thinking men</i>. I remember all
      these things distinctly; for I was with them, heard them, and was one of
      them. Mr. Lincoln here found other works,&mdash;Hume, Gibbon, and others,&mdash;and
      drank them in: he made no secret of his views, no concealment of his
      religion. He boldly avowed himself an infidel. When Mr. Lincoln was a
      candidate for our Legislature, he was accused of being an infidel, and of
      having said that Jesus Christ was an illegitimate child: he never denied
      his opinions, nor flinched from his religious views; he was a true man,
      and yet it may be truthfully said, that in 1837 his religion was low
      indeed. In his moments of gloom he would <i>doubt, if he did not sometimes
      deny, God</i>. He made me once erase the name of God from a speech which I
      was about to make in 1854; and he did this in the city of Washington to
      one of his friends. I cannot now name the man, nor the place he occupied
      in Washington: it will be known sometime. I have the evidence, and intend
      to keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln ran for Congress, against the Rev. Peter Cartwright, in the
      year 1847 or 1848. In that contest he was accused of being an infidel, if
      not an atheist; he never denied the charge; would not; "<i>would die first</i>:"
      in the first place, because he knew it could and would be proved on him;
      and in the second place he was too true to his own convictions, to his own
      soul, to deny it. From what I know of Mr. Lincoln, and from what I have
      heard and verily believe, I can say, First, That he <i>did not believe in
      a special creation, his idea being that all creation was an evolution
      under law</i>; Secondly, That he did not believe that the Bible was a
      special revelation from God, as the Christian world contends; Thirdly, He
      did not believe in miracles, as understood by the Christian world;
      Fourthly, He believed in universal inspiration and miracles under law;
      Fifthly, He did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God, as
      the Christian world contends; Sixthly, He believed that all things, both
      matter and mind, were governed by laws, universal, absolute, and eternal.
      All his speeches and remarks in Washington conclusively prove this. <i>Law
      was to Lincoln every thing, and special interferences shams and delusions</i>.
      I know whereof I speak. I used to loan him Theodore Parker's works: I
      loaned him Emerson sometimes, and other writers; and he would sometimes
      read, and sometimes would not, as I suppose,&mdash;nay, know.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Lincoln left this city for Washington, I know he had undergone no
      change in his religious opinions or views. He held many of the Christian
      ideas in abhorrence, and among them there was this one; namely, that God
      would forgive the sinner for a violation of his laws. <i>Lincoln
      maintained that God could not forgive; that punishment has to follow the
      sin; that Christianity was wrong in teaching forgiveness</i>; that it
      tended to make man sin in the hope that God would excuse, and so forth.
      Lincoln contended that the minister should teach that God has affixed
      punishment to sin, and that <i>no repentance could bribe him to remit it</i>.
      In one sense of the word, Mr. Lincoln was a Universalist, and in another
      sense he was a Unitarian; but he was a theist, as we now understand that
      word: he was so fully, freely, unequivocally, boldly, and openly, when
      asked for his views. Mr. Lincoln was supposed, by many people in this
      city, to be an atheist; and some still believe it. I can put that
      supposition at rest forever. I hold a letter of Mr. Lincoln in my hand,
      addressed to his step-brother, John D. Johnston, and dated the twelfth day
      of January, 1851. He had heard from Johnston that his father, Thomas
      Lincoln, was sick, and that no hopes of his recovery were entertained. Mr.
      Lincoln wrote back to Mr. Johnston these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sincerely hope that father may yet recover his health; but, at all
      events, tell him to remember to call upon and confide in One great and
      good and merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity.
      He notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads; and he
      will not forget the dying man who puts his trust in him. Say to him, that,
      if we could meet now, it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful
      than pleasant; but that, if it be his lot to go now, he will soon have a
      joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before, and where the rest of us,
      through the help of God, hope ere long to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A. Lincoln."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seems that Mr. Lincoln believed in God and immortality as well as
      heaven,&mdash;a place. He believed in no hell and no punishment in the
      future world. It has been said to me that Mr. Lincoln wrote the above
      letter to an old man simply to cheer him up in his last moments, and that
      the writer did not believe what he said. The question is, Was Mr. Lincoln
      an honest and truthful man? If he was, he wrote that letter honestly,
      believing it. It has to me the sound, the ring, of an honest utterance. I
      admit that Mr. Lincoln, in his moments of melancholy and terrible gloom,
      was living on the borderland between theism and atheism,&mdash;sometimes
      quite wholly dwelling in atheism. In his happier moments he would swing
      back to theism, and dwell lovingly there. It is possible that Mr. Lincoln
      was not always responsible for what he said or thought, so deep, so
      intense, so terrible, was his melancholy. I send you a lecture of mine
      which will help you to see what I mean. I maintain that Mr. Lincoln was a
      deeply-religious man at all times and places, in spite of his transient
      doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Mr. Lincoln was assassinated, Mr. Holland came into my office,
      and made some inquiries about him, stating to me his purpose of writing
      his life. I freely told him what he asked, and much more. He then asked me
      what I thought about Mr. Lincoln's religion, meaning his views of
      Christianity. I replied, "The less said, the better." Mr. Holland has
      recorded my expression to him (see Holland's "Life of Lincoln," p. 241). I
      cannot say what Mr. Holland said to me, as that was private. It appears
      that he went and saw Mr. Newton Bateman, Superintendent of Public
      Instruction in this State. It appears that Mr. Bateman told Mr. Holland
      many things, if he is correctly represented in Holland's "Life of Lincoln"
      (pp. 236-241, inclusive). I doubt whether Mr. Bateman said in full what is
      recorded there: I doubt a great deal of it. I know the whole story is
      untrue,&mdash;untrue in substance, untrue in fact and spirit. As soon as
      the "Life of Lincoln" was out, on reading that part here referred to, I
      instantly sought Mr. Bateman, and found him in his office. I spoke to him
      politely and kindly, and he spoke to me in the same manner. I said
      substantially to him that Mr. Holland, in order to make Mr. Lincoln a
      technical Christian, made him a hypocrite; and so his "Life of Lincoln"
      quite plainly says. I loved Mr. Lincoln, and was mortified, if not angry,
      to see him made a hypocrite. I cannot now detail what Mr. Bateman said, as
      it was a private conversation, and I am forbidden to make use of it in
      public. If some good gentleman can only get the seal of secrecy removed, I
      can show what was said and done. On my word, the world may take it for
      granted that Holland is wrong, that he does not state Mr. Lincoln's views
      correctly. Mr. Bateman, if correctly represented in Holland's "Life of
      Lincoln," is the only man, the sole and only man, who dare say that Mr.
      Lincoln believed in Jesus as the Christ of God, as the Christian world
      represents. This is not a pleasant situation for Mr. Bateman. I have notes
      and dates of our conversation; and the world will sometime know who is
      truthful, and who is otherwise. I doubt whether Bateman is correctly
      represented by Holland. My notes bear date Dec. 3, 12, and 28, 1866. Some
      of our conversations were in the spring of 1866 and the fall of 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not remember ever seeing the words Jesus or Christ in print, as
      uttered by Mr. Lincoln. If he has used these words, they can be found. He
      uses the word God but seldom. I never heard him use the name of Christ or
      Jesus but to confute the idea that he was the Christ, the only and truly
      begotten Son of God, as the Christian world understands it. The idea that
      Mr. Lincoln carried the New Testament or Bible in his bosom or boots, to
      draw on his opponent in debate, is ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear sir, I now have given you my knowledge, speaking from my own
      experience, of Mr. Lincoln's religious views. I speak likewise from the
      evidences, carefully gathered, of his religious opinions. I likewise speak
      from the ears and mouths of many in this city; and, after all careful
      examination, I declare to your numerous readers, that Mr. Lincoln is
      correctly represented here, so far as I know what truth is, and how it
      should be investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever there was a moment when Mr. Lincoln might have been expected to
      express his faith in the atonement, his trust in the merits of a living
      Redeemer, it was when he undertook to send a composing and comforting
      message to a dying man. He knew, moreover, that his father had been
      "converted" time and again, and that no exhortation would so effectually
      console his weak spirit in the hour of dismay and dissolution as one which
      depicted, in the strongest terms, the perfect sufficiency of Jesus to save
      the perishing soul. But he omitted it wholly: he did not even mention the
      name of Jesus, or intimate the most distant suspicion of the existence of
      a Christ. On the contrary, he is singularly careful to employ the word
      "One" to qualify the word "Maker." It is the Maker, and not the Saviour,
      to whom he directs the attention of a sinner in the agony of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is very clear that Mr. Lincoln was at all times an infidel in the
      orthodox meaning of the term, it is also very clear that he was not at all
      times equally willing that everybody should know it. He never offered to
      purge or recant; but he was a wily politician, and did not disdain to
      regulate his religious manifestations with some reference to his political
      interests. As he grew older, he grew more cautious; and as his New Salem
      associates, and the aggressive deists with whom he originally united at
      Springfield, gradually dispersed, or fell away from his side, he
      appreciated more and more keenly the violence and extent of the religious
      prejudices which freedom in discussion from his standpoint would be sure
      to arouse against him. He saw the immense and augmenting power of the
      churches, and in times past had practically felt it. The imputation of
      infidelity had seriously injured him in several of his earlier political
      contests; and, sobered by age and experience, he was resolved that that
      same imputation should injure him no more. Aspiring to lead religious
      communities, he foresaw that he must not appear as an enemy within their
      gates; aspiring to public honors under the auspices of a political party
      which persistently summoned religious people to assist in the extirpation
      of that which is denounced as the "nation's sin," he foresaw that he could
      not ask their suffrages whilst aspersing their faith. He perceived no
      reason for changing his convictions, but he did perceive many good and
      cogent reasons for not making them public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Matheny alleges, that, from 1854 to 1860, Mr. Lincoln "played a sharp
      game" upon the Christians of Springfield, "treading their toes," and
      saying, "Come and convert me." Mr. Herndon is inclined to coincide with
      Matheny; and both give the obvious explanation of such conduct; that is to
      say, his morbid ambition; coupled with a mortal fear that his popularity
      would suffer by an open avowal of his deistic convictions. At any rate,
      Mr. Lincoln permitted himself to be misunderstood and misrepresented by
      some enthusiastic ministers and exhorters with whom he came in contact.
      Among these was the Rev. Mr. Smith, then pastor of the First Presbyterian
      Church of Springfield, and afterwards Consul at Dundee, in Scotland, under
      Mr. Lincoln's appointment. The abilities of this gentleman to discuss such
      a topic to the edification of a man like Mr. Lincoln seem to have been
      rather slender; but the chance of converting so distinguished a person
      inspired him with a zeal which he might not have felt for the salvation of
      an obscurer soul. Mr. Lincoln listened to his exhortations in silence,
      apparently respectful, and occasionally sat out his sermons in church with
      as much patience as other people. Finding these oral appeals unavailing,
      Mr. Smith composed a heavy tract out of his own head to suit the
      particular case. "The preparation of that work," says he, "cost me long
      and arduous labor;" but it does not appear to have been read. Mr. Lincoln
      took the "work" to his office, laid it down without writing his name on
      it, and never took it up again to the knowledge of a man who inhabited
      that office with him, and who saw it lying on the same spot every day for
      months. Subsequently Mr. Smith drew from Mr. Lincoln an acknowledgment
      that his argument was unanswerable,&mdash;not a very high compliment under
      the circumstances, but one to which Mr. Smith often referred afterwards
      with great delight. He never asserted, as some have supposed, that Mr.
      Lincoln was converted from the error of his ways; that he abandoned his
      infidel opinions, or that he united himself with any Christian church. On
      the contrary, when specially interrogated on these points by Mr. Herndon,
      he refused to answer, on the ground that Mr. Herndon was not a proper
      person to receive such a communication from Mr. Newton Bateman is reported
      to have said that a few days before the Presidential election of 1860, Mr.
      Lincoln came into his office, closed the door against intrusion, and
      proposed to examine a book which had been furnished him, at his own
      request, "containing a careful canvass of the city of Springfield, showing
      the candidate for whom each citizen had declared his intention to vote at
      the approaching election. He ascertained that only three ministers of the
      gospel, out of twenty-three, would vote for him, and that, of the
      prominent church-members, a very large majority were against him." Mr.
      Bateman does not say so directly, but the inference is plain that Mr.
      Lincoln had not previously known what were the sentiments of the Christian
      people who lived with him in Springfield: he had never before taken the
      trouble to inquire whether they were for him or against him. At all
      events, when he made the discovery out of the book, he wept, and declared
      that he "did not understand it at all." He drew from his bosom a pocket
      New Testament, and, "with a trembling voice and his cheeks wet with
      tears," quoted it against his political opponents generally, and
      especially against Douglas. He professed to believe that the opinions
      adopted by him and his party were derived from the teachings of Christ;
      averred that Christ was God; and, speaking of the Testament which he
      carried in his bosom, called it "this rock, on which him I stand." When
      Mr. Bateman expressed surprise, and told him that his friends generally
      were ignorant that he entertained such sentiments, he gave this answer
      quickly: "I know they are: I am obliged to appear different to them." Mr.
      Bateman is a respectable citizen, whose general reputation for truth and
      veracity is not to be impeached; but his story, as reported in Holland's
      Life, is so inconsistent with Mr. Lincoln's whole character, that it must
      be rejected as altogether incredible. From the time of the Democratic
      split in the Baltimore Convention, Mr. Lincoln, as well as every other
      politician of the smallest sagacity, knew that his success was as certain
      as any future event could be. At the end of October, most of the States
      had clearly voted in a way which left no lingering doubts of the final
      result of November. If there ever was a time in his life when ambition
      charmed his whole heart,&mdash;if it could ever be said of him that "hope
      elevated and joy brightened his crest," it was on the eve of that election
      which he saw was to lift him at last to the high place for which he had
      sighed and struggled so long. It was not then that he would mourn and weep
      because he was in danger of not getting the votes of the ministers and
      members of the churches he had known during many years for his steadfast
      opponents: he did not need them, and had not expected them. Those who
      understood him best are very sure that he never, under any circumstances,
      could have fallen into such weakness&mdash;not even when his fortunes were
      at the lowest point of depression&mdash;as to play the part of a hypocrite
      for their support. Neither is it possible that he was at any loss about
      the reasons which religious men had for refusing him their support; and,
      if he said that he could not understand it at all, he must have spoken
      falsely. But the worst part of the tale is Mr. Lincoln's acknowledgment
      that his "friends generally were deceived concerning his religious
      sentiments, and that he was obliged to appear different to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this version, which has had considerable currency, he carried
      a Testament in his bosom, carefully hidden from his intimate associates:
      he believed that Christ was God; yet his friends understood him to deny
      the verity of the gospel: he based his political doctrines on the
      teachings of the Bible; yet before all men, except Mr. Bateman, he
      habitually acted the part of an unbeliever and reprobate, because he was
      "obliged to appear different to them." How obliged? What compulsion
      required him to deny that Christ was God if he really believed him to be
      divine? Or did he put his political necessities above the obligations of
      truth, and oppose Christianity against his convictions, that he might win
      the favor of its enemies? It may be that his mere silence was sometimes
      misunderstood; but he never made an express avowal of any religious
      opinion which he did not entertain. He did not "appear different" at one
      time from what he was at another, and certainly he never put on infidelity
      as a mere mask to conceal his Christian character from the world. There is
      no dealing with Mr. Bateman, except by a flat contradiction. Perhaps his
      memory was treacherous, or his imagination led him astray, or,
      peradventure, he thought a fraud no harm if it gratified the strong desire
      of the public for proofs of Mr. Lincoln's orthodoxy. It is nothing to the
      purpose that Mr. Lincoln said once or twice that he thought this or that
      portion of the Scripture was the product of divine inspiration; for he was
      one of the class who hold that all truth is inspired, and that every human
      being with a mind and a conscience is a prophet. He would have agreed much
      more readily with one who taught that Newton's discoveries, or Bacon's
      philosophy, or one of his own speeches, were the works of men divinely
      inspired above their fellows.1

        1 "As we have bodily senses to lay hold on matter, and supply bodily
        wants, through which we obtain, naturally, all needed material things;
        so we have spiritual faculties to lay hold on God and supply spiritual
        wants: through them we obtain all needed spiritual things. As we observe
        the conditions of the body, we have nature on our side: as we observe
        the law of the soul, we have God on our side. He imparts truth to all
        men who observe these conditions: we have direct access to him through
        reason, conscience, and the religious faculty, just as we have direct
        access to nature through the eye, the ear, or the hand. Through these
        channels, and by means of a law, certain, regular, and universal as
        gravitation, God inspires men, makes revelation of truth; for is not
        truth as much a phenomenon of God as motion of matter? Therefore, if God
        be omnipresent and omniactive, this inspiration is no miracle, but a
        regular mode of God's action on conscious spirit, as gravitation on
        unconscious matter. It is not a rare condescension of God, but a
        universal uplifting of man. To obtain a knowledge of duty, a man is not
        sent away, outside of himself, to ancient documents: for the only rule
        of faith and practice, the Word, is very nigh him, even in his heart,
        and by this Word he is to try all documents whatsoever. Inspiration,
        like God's omnipresence, is not limited to the few writers claimed by
        the Jews, Christians, or Mohammedans, but is co- extensive with the
        race. As God fills all space, so all spirit; as he influences and
        constrains unconscious and necessitated matter, so he inspires and helps
        free, unconscious man. "This theory does not make God limited, partial,
        or capricious: it exalts man. While it honors the excellence of a
        religious genius of a Moses or a Jesus, it does not pronounce their
        character monstrous, as the supernatural, nor fanatical, as the
        rationalistic theory; but natural, human, and beautiful, revealing the
        possibility of mankind. Prayer&mdash;whether voluntative or spontaneous,
        a word or a feeling, felt in gratitude, or penitence, or joy, or
        resignation&mdash;is not a soliloquy of the man, not a physiological
        function, nor an address to a deceased man, but a sally into the
        infinite spiritual world, whence we bring back light and truth. There
        are windows towards God, as towards the world. There is no intercessor,
        angel, mediator, between man and God; for man can speak, and God hear,
        each for himself. He requires no advocate to plead for men, who need not
        pray by attorney. Each man stands close to the omnipresent God; may feel
        his beautiful presence, and have familiar access to the All-Father; get
        truth at first hand from its Author. Wisdom, righteousness, and love are
        the Spirit of God in the soul of man: wherever these are, and just in
        proportion to their power, there is inspiration from God. Thus God is
        not the author of confusion, but concord. Faith and knowledge and
        revelation and reason tell the same tale, and so legitimate and confirm
        each one another. "God's action on matter and on man is, perhaps, the
        same thing to him, though it appear differently modified to us. But it
        is plain, from the nature of things, that there can be but one kind of
        inspiration, as of truth, faith, or love: it is the direct and intuitive
        perception of some truth, either of thought or of sentiment. There can
        be but one mode of inspiration: it is the action of the Highest within
        the soul, the divine presence imparting light; this presence, as truth,
        justice, holiness, love, infusing itself into the soul, giving it new
        life; the breathing-in of the Deity; the in-come of God to the soul, in
        the form of truth through the reason, of right through the conscience,
        of love and faith through the affections and religious element. Is
        inspiration confined to theological matter alone? Most certainly not."&mdash;

      But he never told any one that he accepted Jesus as the Christ, or
      performed a single one of the acts which necessarily follow upon such a
      conviction. At Springfield and at Washington he was beset on the one hand
      by political priests, and on the other by honest and prayerful Christians.
      He despised the former, respected the latter, and had use for both. He
      said with characteristic irreverence, that he would not undertake to "run
      the churches by military authority;" but he was, nevertheless, alive to
      the importance of letting the churches "run" themselves in the interest of
      his party. Indefinite expressions about "Divine Providence," the "justice
      of God," "the favor of the Most High," were easy, and not inconsistent
      with his religious notions. In this, accordingly, he indulged freely; but
      never in all that time did he let fall from his lips or his pen an
      expression which remotely implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the Son
      of God and the Saviour of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of Mr. Lincoln's unbelief did not affect his constitutional
      love of justice. Though he rejected the New Testament as a book of divine
      authority, he accepted the practical part of its precepts as binding upon
      him by virtue of the natural law. The benevolence of his impulses served
      to keep him, for the most part, within the limits to which a Christian is
      confined by the fear of God. It is also true beyond doubt that he was
      greatly influenced by the reflected force of Christianity. If he did not
      believe it, the masses of the "plain people" did; and no one ever was more
      anxious to do "whatsoever was of good report among men." To qualify
      himself as a witness or an officer it was frequently necessary that he
      should take oaths; and he always appealed to the Christian's God either by
      laying his hand upon the Gospels, or by some other form of invocation
      common among believers. Of course the ceremony was superfluous, for it
      imposed no religious obligation upon him; but his strong innate sense of
      right was sufficient to make him truthful without that high and awful
      sanction which faith in divine revelation would have carried with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was by no means free from a kind of belief in the
      supernatural. While he rejected the great facts of Christianity, as
      wanting the support of authentic evidence, his mind was readily impressed
      with the most absurd superstitions.1 He lived constantly in the serious
      conviction that he was himself the subject of a special decree, made by
      some unknown and mysterious power, for which he had no name. The birth and
      death of Christ, his wonderful works, and his resurrection as "the
      first-fruits of them that slept," Mr. Lincoln denied, because they seemed
      naturally improbable, or inconsistent with his "philosophy so called;" but
      his perverted credulity terrified him when he saw two images of himself in
      a mirror.

        them credit for greater intelligence than most men do. If he found an
        idea prevailing generally amongst them, he believed there was something
        in it, although it might not harmonize with science. "He had great faith
        in the virtues of the 'mad-stone' although he could give no reason for
        it, and confessed that it looked like superstition. But, he said, he
        found the people in the neighborhood of these stones fully impressed
        with a belief in their virtues from actual experiment; and that was
        about as much as we could ever know of the properties of medicines."&mdash;Gillespie.
        "When his son 'Bob' was supposed to have been bitten by a rabid dog, Mr.
        Lincoln took him to Terre Haute, La., where there was a mad-stone, with
        the intention of having it applied, and, it is presumed, did so."&mdash;Mrs.
        Wallace.

    <p>
      It is very probable that much of Mr. Lincoln's unhappiness, the melancholy
      that "dripped from him as he walked," was due to his want of religious
      faith. When the black fit was on him, he suffered as much mental misery as
      Bunyan or Cowper in the deepest anguish of their conflicts with the evil
      one. But the unfortunate conviction fastened upon him by his early
      associations, that there was no truth in the Bible, made all consolation
      impossible, and penitence useless. To a man of his temperament,
      predisposed as it was to depression of spirits, there could be no chance
      of happiness, if doomed to live without hope and without God in the world.
      He might force himself to be merry with his chosen comrades; he might
      "banish sadness" in mirthful conversation, or find relief in a jest;
      gratified ambition might elevate his feelings, and give him ease for a
      time: but solid comfort and permanent peace could come to him only through
      "a correspondence fixed with heaven." The fatal misfortune of his life,
      looking at it only as it affected him in this world, was the influence at
      New Salem and Springfield which enlisted him on the side of unbelief. He
      paid the bitter penalty in a life of misery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the 11th of February, 1861, the arrangements for Mr. Lincoln's
      departure from Springfield were completed. It was intended to occupy the
      time remaining between that date and the 4th of March with a grand tour
      from State to State and city to city. One Mr. Wood, "recommended by
      Senator Seward," was the chief manager. He provided special trains to be
      preceded by pilot engines all the way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gloomy day: heavy clouds floated overhead, and a cold rain was
      falling. Long before eight o'clock, a great mass of people had collected
      at the station of the Great Western Railway to witness the event of the
      day. At precisely five minutes before eight, Mr. Lincoln, preceded by Mr.
      Wood, emerged from a private room in the dépôt building, and passed slowly
      to the car, the people falling back respectfully on either side, and as
      many as possible shaking his hands. Having finally reached the train, he
      ascended the rear platform, and, facing about to the throng which had
      closed around him, drew himself up to his full height, removed his hat,
      and stood for several seconds in profound silence. His eye roved sadly
      over that sea of upturned faces; and he thought he read in them again the
      sympathy and friendship which he had often tried, and which he never
      needed more than he did then. There was an unusual quiver in his lip, and
      a still more unusual tear on his shrivelled cheek. His solemn manner, his
      long silence, were as full of melancholy eloquence as any words he could
      have uttered. What did he think of? Of the mighty changes which had lifted
      him from the lowest to the highest estate on earth? Of the weary road
      which had brought him to this lofty summit? Of his poor mother lying
      beneath the tangled underbrush in a distant forest? Of that other grave in
      the quiet Concord cemetery? Whatever the particular character of his
      thoughts, it is evident that they were retrospective and painful. To those
      who were anxiously waiting to catch words upon which the fate of the
      nation might hang, it seemed long until he had mastered his feelings
      sufficiently to speak. At length he began in a husky tone of voice, and
      slowly and impressively delivered his farewell to his neighbors. Imitating
      his example, every man in the crowd stood with his head uncovered in the
      fast-falling rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends,&mdash;No one who has never been placed in a like position can
      understand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive sadness I feel at
      this parting. For more than a quarter of a century I have lived among you,
      and during all that time I have received nothing but kindness at your
      hands. Here I have lived from my youth, until now I am an old man. Here
      the most sacred ties of earth were assumed. Here all my children were
      born; and here one of them lies buried. To you, dear friends, I owe all
      that I have, all that I am. All the strange, checkered past seems to crowd
      now upon my mind. To-day I leave you. I go to assume a task more difficult
      than that which devolved upon Washington. Unless the great God, who
      assisted him, shall be with and aid me, I must fail; but if the same
      omniscient mind and almighty arm that directed and protected him shall
      guide and support me, I shall not fail,&mdash;I shall succeed. Let us all
      pray that the God of our fathers may not forsake us now. To him I commend
      you all. Permit me to ask, that, with equal security and faith, you will
      invoke his wisdom and guidance for me. With these few words I must leave
      you: for how long I know not. Friends, one and all, I must now bid you an
      affectionate farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a most impressive scene," said the editor of "The Journal." "We
      have known Mr. Lincoln for many years; we have heard him speak upon a
      hundred different occasions; but we never saw him so profoundly affected,
      nor did he ever utter an address which seemed to us so full of simple and
      touching eloquence, so exactly adapted to the occasion, so worthy of the
      man and the hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock the train rolled out of Springfield amid the cheers of
      the populace. Four years later a funeral train, covered with the emblems
      of splendid mourning, rolled into the same city, bearing a discolored
      corpse, whose obsequies were being celebrated in every part of the
      civilized world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with Mr. Lincoln's family in the special car were Gov. Yates,
      Ex-Gov. Moore, Dr. Wallace (Mr. Lincoln's brother-in-law), Mr. Judd, Mr.
      Browning, Judge Davis, Col. Ellsworth, Col. Lamon, and private secretaries
      Nicolay and Hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been asserted that an attempt was made to throw the train off the
      track between Springfield and Indianapolis, and also that a hand-grenade
      was found on board at Cincinnati, but no evidence of the fact is given in
      either case, and none of the Presidential party ever heard of these
      murderous doings until they read of them in some of the more imaginative
      reports of their trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full accounts of this journey were spread broadcast over the country at
      the time, and have been collected and printed in various books. But,
      except for the speeches of the President elect, those accounts possess no
      particular interest at this day; and of the speeches we shall present here
      only such extracts as express his thoughts and feelings about the
      impending civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heat of the late canvass, he had written the following private
      letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Springfield, Ill., Aug. 15, 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      John B. Fry, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;Yours of the 9th, enclosing the letter of Hon. John M.
      Botts, was duly received. The latter is herewith returned, according to
      your request. It contains one of the many assurances I receive from the
      South, that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort
      to break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense
      and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government, rather than see it
      administered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least, so I
      hope and believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours very truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion expressed in the letter as to the probability of war does not
      appear to have undergone any material change or modification during the
      eventful months which had intervened; for he expressed it in much stronger
      terms at almost every stage of his progress to Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Toledo he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am leaving you on an errand of national importance, attended, as you
      are aware, with considerable difficulties. Let us believe, as some poet
      has expressed it, 'Behind the cloud the sun is shining still.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      At Indianapolis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am here to thank you for this magnificent welcome, and still more for
      the very generous support given by your State to that political cause,
      which, I think, is the true and just cause of the whole country, and the
      whole world. Solomon says, 'There is a time to keep silence;' and when men
      wrangle by the mouth, with no certainty that they mean the same thing
      while using the same words, it perhaps were as well if they would keep
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The words 'coercion' and 'invasion' are much used in these days, and
      often with some temper and hot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, that we
      do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them. Let us get the
      exact definitions of these words, not from dictionaries, but from the men
      themselves, who certainly deprecate the things they would represent by the
      use of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, then, is coercion? What is invasion? Would the marching of an army
      into South Carolina, without the consent of her people, and with hostile
      intent toward them, be invasion? I certainly think it would; and it would
      be coercion also, if the South Carolinians were forced to submit. But if
      the United States should merely hold and retake its own forts and other
      property, and collect the duties on foreign importations, or even withhold
      the mails from places where they were' habitually violated, would any or
      all of these things be invasion or coercion? Do our professed lovers of
      the Union, who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and
      invasion, understand that such things as these, on the part of the United
      States, would be coercion or invasion of a State? If so, their idea of
      means to preserve the object of their great affection would seem to be
      exceedingly thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the homoeopathist
      would be much too large for them to swallow. In their view, the Union, as
      a family relation, would seem to be no regular marriage, but rather a sort
      of 'free-love' arrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Columbus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of
      the new administration. In this, I have received from some a degree of
      credit for having kept silence, from others some depreciation. I still
      think I was right. In the varying and repeatedly-shifting scenes of the
      present, <i>without a precedent which could enable me to judge for the
      past</i>, it has seemed fitting, that, before speaking upon the
      difficulties of the country, I should have gained a view of the whole
      field. To be sure, after all, I would be at liberty to modify and change
      the course of policy as future events might make a change necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety. <i>It is a
      good thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going
      wrong. It is a consoling circumstance, that when we look out there is
      nothing that really hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon
      political questions; but nobody is suffering any thing. This is a most
      consoling circumstance, and from it I judge that all we want is time and
      patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this people</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pittsburg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notwithstanding the troubles across the river, <i>there is really no
      crisis springing from any thing in the Government itself. In plain words,
      there is really no crisis, except an artificial one.</i> What is there now
      to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends 'over the
      river'? Take even their own view of the questions involved, and there is
      nothing to justify the course which they are pursuing. <i>I repeat it,
      then, there is no crisis, except such a one as may be gotten up at any
      time by turbulent men, aided by designing politicians</i>. My advice,
      then, under such circumstances, is <i>to keep cool. If the great American
      people will only keep their temper on both sides of the line, the trouble
      will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will
      be settled just as surely as all other difficulties of like character
      which have originated in this Government have been adjusted. Let the
      people on both sides keep their self-possession, and, just as other clouds
      have cleared away in due time, so will this; and this great nation shall
      continue to prosper as heretofore</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cleveland:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frequent allusion is made to the excitement at present existing in our
      national politics, and it is as well that I should also allude to it here.
      <i>I think that there is no occasion for any excitement. The crisis, as it
      is called, is altogether an artificial crisis.... As I said before, this
      crisis is all artificial! It has no foundation in fact. It was not 'argued
      up,' as the saying is, and cannot be argued down. Let it alone, and it
      will go down itself</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Legislature of New York:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the time comes, according to the custom of the Government, I shall
      speak, and speak as well as I am able for the good of the present and of
      the future of this country,&mdash;for the good of the North and of the
      South, for the good of one and of the other, and of all sections of it. In
      the mean time, <i>if we have patience, if we maintain our equanimity,
      though some may allow themselves to run off in a burst of passion</i>, I
      still have confidence that the Almighty Ruler of the Universe, through the
      instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, can and will bring
      us through this difficulty, as he has heretofore brought us through all
      preceding difficulties of the country. Relying upon this, and again
      thanking you, as I forever shall, in my heart, for this generous reception
      you have given me, I bid you farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to the Mayor of New York City, who had said, "To you,
      therefore, chosen under the forms of the Constitution, as the head of the
      Confederacy, we look for a restoration of fraternal relations between the
      States,&mdash;only to be accomplished by peaceful and conciliatory means,
      aided by the wisdom of Almighty God," Mr. Lincoln said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which
      you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly, I can only say
      that I agree with the sentiments expressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Trenton:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall endeavor to take the ground I deem most just to the North, the
      East, the West, the South, and the whole country. I take it, I hope, in
      good temper,&mdash;certainly with no malice towards any section. <i>I
      shall do all that may be in my power to promote a peaceful settlement of
      all our difficulties. The man does not live who is more devoted to peace
      than I am,&mdash;none who would do more to preserve it. But it maybe
      necessary to put the foot down firmly</i>. And if I do my duty, and do
      right, you will sustain me: will you not? Received, as I am, by the
      members of a legislature, the majority of whom do not agree with me in
      political sentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting
      the Ship of State through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for,
      if it should suffer shipwreck now, there will be no pilot ever needed for
      another voyage."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Philadelphia:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, as your worthy mayor has said, that there is anxiety among
      the citizens of the United States at this time. I deem it a happy
      circumstance that this dissatisfied portion of our fellow-citizens do not
      point us to any thing in which they are being injured, or are about to be
      injured; <i>for which reason I have felt all the while justified in
      concluding that the crisis, the panic, the anxiety, of the country at this
      time is artificial.</i> If there be those who differ with me upon this
      subject, they have not pointed out the substantial difficulty that exists.
      I do not mean to say that an artificial panic may not do considerable
      harm: that it has done such I do not deny. The hope that has been
      expressed by your mayor, that I may be able to restore peace, harmony, and
      prosperity to the country, is most worthy of him; and happy indeed will I
      be if I shall be able to verify and fulfil that hope. I promise you, in
      all sincerity, that I bring to the work a sincere heart. Whether I will
      bring a head equal to that heart, will be for future times to determine.
      It were useless for me to speak of details or plans now: I shall speak
      officially next Monday week, if ever. If I should not speak then, it were
      useless for me to do so now."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Philadelphia again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, in my view of the present aspect of affairs, there need be no
      bloodshed or war. <i>There is no necessity for it. I am not in favor of
      such a course: and I may say, in advance, that there will be no blood shed
      unless it be forced upon the Government; and then it will be compelled to
      act in self-defence.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      At Harrisburg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in
      regard to what has been said about the military support which the General
      Government may expect from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper
      emergency. <i>To guard against any possible mistake, do I recur to this.
      It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a
      necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm</i>.
      While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your
      streets of your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your
      promise here to use that force upon a proper emergency; while I make these
      acknowledgments, I desire to repeat, in order to <i>preclude any possible
      misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use
      for them; that it will never become their duty to shed Hood, and most
      especially never to shed fraternal blood</i>. I promise that, so far as I
      have wisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought
      about, it shall be through no fault of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Mr. Lincoln, in the midst of his suite and attendants, was being
      borne in triumph through the streets of Philadelphia, and a countless
      multitude of people were shouting themselves hoarse, and jostling and
      crushing each other around his carriage-wheels, Mr. Felton, the President
      of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railway, was engaged with a
      private detective discussing the details of an alleged conspiracy to
      murder him at Baltimore. Some months before, Mr. Felton, apprehending
      danger to the bridges along his line, had taken this man into his pay, and
      sent him to Baltimore to spy out and report any plot that might be found
      for their destruction. Taking with him a couple of other men and a woman,
      the detective went about his business with the zeal which necessarily
      marks his peculiar profession. He set up as a stock-broker, under an
      assumed name, opened an office, and became a vehement Secessionist. His
      agents were instructed to act with the duplicity which such men generally
      use, to be rabid on the subject of "Southern rights," to suggest all
      manner of crimes in vindication of them; and if, by these arts,
      corresponding sentiments should be elicited from their victims, the "job"
      might be considered as prospering. Of course they readily found out what
      everybody else knew,&mdash;that Maryland was in a state of great alarm;
      that her people were forming military associations, and that Gov. Hicks
      was doing his utmost to furnish them with arms, on condition that the
      arms, in case of need, should be turned against the Federal Government.
      Whether they detected any plan to burn bridges or not, the chief detective
      does not relate; but it appears that he soon deserted that inquiry, and
      got, or pretended to get, upon a scent that promised a heavier reward.
      Being intensely ambitious to shine in the professional way, and something
      of a politician besides, it struck him that it would be a particularly
      fine thing to discover a dreadful plot to assassinate the President elect;
      and he discovered it accordingly. It was easy to get that far: to furnish
      tangible proofs of an imaginary conspiracy was a more difficult matter.
      But Baltimore was seething with political excitement; numerous strangers
      from the far South crowded its hotels and boarding-houses; great numbers
      of mechanics and laborers out of employment encumbered its streets; and
      everywhere politicians, merchants, mechanics, laborers, and loafers were
      engaged in heated discussions about the anticipated war, and the
      probability of Northern troops being marched through Maryland to slaughter
      and pillage beyond the Potomac. It would seem like an easy thing to
      beguile a few individuals of this angry and excited multitude into the
      expression of some criminal desire; and the opportunity was not wholly
      lost, although the limited success of the detective under such favorable
      circumstances is absolutely wonderful. He put his "shadows" upon several
      persons, whom it suited his pleasure to suspect; and the "shadows" pursued
      their work with the keen zest and the cool treachery of their kind. They
      reported daily to their chief in writing, as he reported in turn to his
      employer. These documents are neither edifying nor useful: they prove
      nothing but the baseness of the vocation which gave them existence. They
      were furnished to Mr. Herndon in full, under the impression that partisan
      feeling had extinguished in him the love of truth, and the obligations of
      candor, as it had in many writers who preceded him on the same
      subject-matter. They have been carefully and thoroughly read, analyzed,
      examined, and Compared, with an earnest and conscientious desire to
      discover the truth, if, perchance, any trace of truth might be in them.
      The process of investigation began with a strong bias in favor of the
      conclusion at which the detective had arrived. For ten years the author
      implicitly believed in the reality of the atrocious plot which these spies
      were supposed to have detected and thwarted; and for ten years he had
      pleased himself with the reflection that he also had done something to
      defeat the bloody purpose of the assassins. It was a conviction which
      could scarcely have been overthrown by evidence less powerful than the
      detective's weak and contradictory account of his own case. In that
      account there is literally nothing to sustain the accusation, and much to
      rebut it. It is perfectly manifest that there was no conspiracy,&mdash;no
      conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of three; no definite
      purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr. Lincoln at Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reports are all in the form of personal narratives, and for the most
      relate when the spies went to bed, when they rose, where they ate, what
      saloons and brothels they visited, and what blackguards they met and
      "drinked" with. One of them "shadowed" a loud-mouthed, drinking fellow,
      named Luckett, and another, a poor scapegrace and braggart, named
      Hilliard. These wretches "drinked" and talked a great deal, hung about
      bars, haunted disreputable houses, were constantly half-drunk, and easily
      excited to use big and threatening words by the faithless protestations
      and cunning management of the spies. Thus Hilliard was made to say that he
      thought a man who should act the part of Brutus in these times would
      deserve well of his country; and Luckett was induced to declare that he
      knew a man who would kill Lincoln. At length the great arch-conspirator&mdash;the
      Brutus, the Orsini, of the New World, to whom Luckett and Hilliard, the
      "national volunteers," and all such, were as mere puppets&mdash;condescended
      to reveal himself in the most obliging and confiding manner. He made no
      mystery of his cruel and desperate scheme. He did not guard it as a
      dangerous secret, or choose his confidants with the circumspection which
      political criminals, and especially assassins, have generally thought
      proper to observe. Very many persons knew what he was about, and levied on
      their friends for small sums&mdash;five, ten, and twenty dollars&mdash;to
      further the "captain's" plan. Even Luckett was deep enough in the awful
      plot to raise money for it; and when he took one of the spies to a public
      bar-room, and introduced him to the "captain," the latter sat down and
      talked it all over without the slightest reserve. When was there ever
      before such a loud-mouthed conspirator, such a trustful and innocent
      assassin! His name was Ferrandina, his occupation that of a barber, his
      place of business beneath Barnum's Hotel, where the sign of the
      bloodthirsty villain still invites the unsuspecting public to come in for
      a shave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Luckett," so the spy relates, "said that he was not going home this
      evening; and if I would meet him at Barr's saloon, on South Street, he
      would introduce me to Ferrandina.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was unexpected to me; but I determined to take the chances, and
      agreed to meet Mr. Luckett at the place named at 7, p.m. Mr. Luckett left
      about 2.30, p.m.; and I went to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was at the office in the afternoon in hopes that Mr. Felton might call,
      but he did not; and at 6.15, p.m., I went to supper. After supper, I went
      to Barr's saloon, and found Mr. Luckett and several other gentlemen there.
      He asked me to drink, and introduced me to Capt. Ferrandina and Capt.
      Turner. He eulogized me very highly as a neighbor of his, and told
      Ferrandina that I was the gentleman who had given the twenty-five dollars
      he (Luckett) had given to Ferrandina.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The conversation at once got into politics; and Ferrandina, who is a
      fine-looking, intelligent-appearing person, became very excited. He shows
      the Italian in, I think, a very marked degree; and, although excited, yet
      was cooler than what I had believed was the general characteristic of
      Italians. He has lived South for many years, and is thoroughly imbued with
      the idea that the South must rule; that they (Southerners) have been
      outraged in their rights by the election of Lincoln, and freely justified
      resorting to any means to prevent Lincoln from taking his seat; and, as he
      spoke, his eyes fairly glared and glistened, and his whole frame quivered,
      but he was fully conscious of all he was doing. He is a man well
      calculated for controlling and directing the ardent-minded: he is an
      enthusiast, and believes, that, to use his own words, 'murder of any kind
      is justifiable and right to save the rights of the Southern people.' In
      all his views he was ably seconded by Capt. Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capt. Turner is an American; but although very much of a gentleman, and
      possessing warm Southern feelings, he is not by any means so dangerous a
      man as Ferrandina, as his ability for exciting others is less powerful;
      but that he is a bold and proud man there is no doubt, as also that he is
      entirely under the control of Ferrandina. In fact, it could not be
      otherwise: for even I myself felt the influence of this man's strange
      power; and, wrong though I knew him to be, I felt strangely unable to keep
      my mind balanced against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ferrandina said, 'Never, never, shall Lincoln be President. His life
      (Ferrandina's) was of no consequence: he was willing to give it up for
      Lincoln's; he would sell it for that Abolitionist's; and as Orsini had
      given his life for Italy, so was he (Ferrandina) ready to die for his
      country, and the rights of the South; and, said Ferrandina, turning to
      Capt. Turner, 'We shall all die together: we shall show the North that we
      fear them not. Every man, captain,' said he, 'will on that day prove
      himself a hero. The first shot fired, the main traitor (Lincoln) dead, and
      all Maryland will be with us, and the South shall be free; and the North
      must then be ours.'&mdash;'Mr. Hutchins,' said Ferrandina, 'if I alone
      must do it, I shall: Lincoln shall die in this city.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst we were thus talking, we (Mr. Luckett, Turner, Ferrandina, and
      myself) were alone in one corner of the barroom; and, while talking, two
      strangers had got pretty near us. Mr. Luckett called Ferrandina's
      attention to this, and intimated that they were listening; and we went up
      to the bar, drinked again at my expense, and again retired to another part
      of the room, at Ferrandina's request, to see if the strangers would again
      follow us: whether by accident or design, they again got near us; but of
      course we were not talking of any matter of consequence. Ferrandina said
      he suspected they were spies, and suggested that he had to attend a secret
      meeting, and was apprehensive that the two strangers might follow him;
      and, at Mr. Luckett's request, I remained with him (Luckett) to watch the
      movements of the strangers. I assured Ferrandina, that, if they would
      attempt to follow him, that we would whip them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ferrandina and Turner left to attend the meeting; and, anxious as I was
      to follow them myself, I was obliged to remain with Mr. Luckett to watch
      the strangers, which we did for about fifteen minutes, when Mr. Luckett
      said that he should go to a friend's to stay over night, and I left for my
      hotel, arriving there at about 9, p.m., and soon retired."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in a secret communication between hireling spies and paid informers
      that these ferocious sentiments are attributed to the poor knight of the
      soap-pot. No disinterested person would believe the story upon such
      evidence; and it will appear hereafter, that even the detective felt that
      it was too weak to mention among his strong points at that decisive
      moment, when he revealed all he knew to the President and his friends. It
      is probably a mere fiction. If it had had any foundation in fact, we are
      inclined to believe that the sprightly and eloquent barber would have
      dangled at a rope's end long since. He would hardly have been left to
      shave and plot in peace, while the members of the Legislature, the
      police-marshal, and numerous private gentlemen, were locked up in Federal
      prisons. When Mr. Lincoln was actually slain, four years later, and the
      cupidity of the detectives was excited by enormous rewards, Ferrandina was
      totally unmolested. But even if Ferrandina really said all that is here
      imputed to him, he did no more than many others around him were doing at
      the same time. He drank and talked, and made swelling speeches; but he
      never took, nor seriously thought of taking, the first step toward the
      frightful tragedy he is said to have contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detectives are cautious not to include in the supposed plot to murder
      any person of eminence, power, or influence. Their game is all of the
      smaller sort, and, as they conceived, easily taken,&mdash;witless
      vagabonds like Hilliard and Luckett, and a barber, whose calling indicates
      his character and associations. They had no fault to find with the
      governor of the State: he was rather a lively trimmer, to be sure, and
      very anxious to turn up at last on the winning side; but it was manifestly
      impossible that one in such exalted station could meditate murder. Yet, if
      they had pushed their inquiries with an honest desire to get at the truth,
      they might have found much stronger evidence against the governor than
      that which they pretend to have found against the barber. In the
      governor's case the evidence is documentary, written, authentic,&mdash;over
      his own hand, clear and conclusive as pen and ink could make it. As early
      as the previous November, Gov. Hicks had written the following letter;
      and, notwithstanding its treasonable and murderous import, the writer
      became conspicuously loyal before spring, and lived to reap splendid
      rewards and high honors under the auspices of the Federal Government, as
      the most patriotic and devoted Union man in Maryland. The person to whom
      the letter was addressed was equally fortunate; and, instead of drawing
      out his comrades in the field to "kill Lincoln and his men," he was sent
      to Congress by power exerted from Washington at a time when the
      administration selected the representatives of Maryland, and performed all
      his duties right loyally and acceptably. Shall one be taken, and another
      left? Shall Hicks go to the Senate, and Webster to Congress, while the
      poor barber is held to the silly words which he is alleged to have
      sputtered out between drinks in a low groggery, under the blandishments
      and encouragements of an eager spy, itching for his reward?

      With the Presidential party was Hon. Norman B. Judd: he was supposed to
      exercise unbounded influence over the new President; and with him,
      therefore, the detective opened communications. At various places along
      the route, Mr. Judd was given vague hints of the impending danger,
      accompanied by the usual assurances of the skill and activity of the
      patriots who were perilling their lives in a rebel city to save that of
      the Chief Magistrate. When he reached New York, he was met by the woman
      who had originally gone with the other spies to Baltimore. She had urgent
      messages from her chief,&mdash;messages that disturbed Mr. Judd
      exceedingly. The detective was anxious to meet Mr. Judd and the President;
      and a meeting was accordingly arranged to take place at Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln reached Philadelphia on the afternoon of the 21st. The
      detective had arrived in the morning, and improved the interval to impress
      and enlist Mr. Felton. In the evening he got Mr. Judd and Mr. Felton into
      his room at the St. Louis Hotel, and told them all he had learned. He
      dwelt at large on the fierce temper of the Baltimore Secessionists; on the
      loose talk he had heard about "fire-balls or hand-grenades;" on a
      "privateer" said to be moored somewhere in the bay; on the organization
      called National Volunteers; on the fact, that, eaves-dropping at Barnum's
      Hotel, he had overheard Marshal Kane intimate that he would not supply a
      police-force on some undefined occasion, but what the occasion was he did
      not know. He made much of his miserable victim, Hilliard, whom he held up
      as a perfect type of the class from which danger was to be apprehended;
      but, concerning "Captain" Ferrandina and his threats, he said, according
      to his own account, not a single word. He had opened his case, his whole
      case, and stated it as strongly as he could. Mr. Judd was very much
      startled, and was sure that it would be extremely imprudent for Mr.
      Lincoln to pass through Baltimore in open daylight, according to the
      published programme. But he thought the detective ought to see the
      President himself; and, as it was wearing toward nine o'clock, there was
      no time to lose. It was agreed that the part taken by the detective and
      Mr. Felton should be kept secret from every one but the President. Mr.
      Sanford, President of the American Telegraph Company, had also been
      co-operating in the business; and the same stipulation was made with
      regard to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Judd went to his own room at the Continental, and the detective
      followed. The crowd in the hotel was very dense, and it took some time to
      get a message to Mr. Lincoln. But it finally reached him, and he responded
      in person. Mr. Judd introduced the detective; and the latter told his
      story over again, with a single variation: this time he mentioned the name
      of Ferrandina along with Hilliard's, but gave no more prominence to one
      than to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Judd and the detective wanted Lincoln to leave for Washington that
      night. This he flatly refused to do. He had engagements with the people,
      he said,&mdash;to raise a flag over Independence Hall in the morning, and
      to exhibit himself at Harrisburg in the afternoon; and these engagements
      he would not break in any event. But he would raise the flag, go to
      Harrisburg, "get away quietly" in the evening, and permit himself to be
      carried to Washington in the way they thought best. Even this, however, he
      conceded with great reluctance. He condescended to cross-examine the
      detective on some parts of his narrative, but at no time did he seem in
      the least degree alarmed. He was earnestly requested not to communicate
      the change of plan to any member of his party, except Mr. Judd, nor permit
      even a suspicion of it to cross the mind of another. To this he replied,
      that he would be compelled to tell Mrs. Lincoln; "and he thought it likely
      that she would insist upon W. H. Lamon going with him; but, aside from
      that, no one should know."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, Mr. Seward had also discovered the conspiracy. He
      despatched his son to Philadelphia to warn the President elect of the
      terrible plot into whose meshes he was about to run. Mr. Lincoln turned
      him over to Judd, and Judd told him they already knew all about it. He
      went away with just enough information to enable his father to anticipate
      the exact moment of Mr. Lincoln's surreptitious arrival in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the morning of the 22d, Mr. Lincoln raised the flag over
      Independence Hall, and departed for Harrisburg. On the way, Mr. Judd "gave
      him a full and precise detail of the arrangements that had been made" the
      previous night. After the conference with the detective, Mr. Sanford, Col.
      Scott, Mr. Felton, railroad and telegraph officials, had been sent for,
      and came to Mr. Judd's room. They occupied nearly the whole of the night
      in perfecting the plan. It was finally understood that about six o'clock
      the next evening Mr. Lincoln should slip away from the Jones Hotel, at
      Harrisburg, in company with a single member of his party. A special car
      and engine would be provided for him on the track outside the dépôt. All
      other trains on the road would be "sidetracked" until this one had passed.
      Mr. Sanford would forward skilled "telegraph-climbers," and see that all
      the wires leading out of Harrisburg were cut at six o'clock, and kept down
      until it was known that Mr. Lincoln had reached Washington in safety. The
      detective would meet Mr. Lincoln at the West Philadelphia dépôt with a
      carriage, and conduct him by a circuitous route to the Philadelphia,
      Wilmington, and Baltimore dépôt. Berths for four would be pre-engaged in
      the sleeping-car attached to the regular midnight train for Baltimore.
      This train Mr. Felton would cause to be detained until the conductor
      should receive a package, containing important "government despatches,"
      addressed to "E. J. Allen, Willard's Hotel, Washington." This package was
      made up of old newspapers, carefully wrapped and sealed, and delivered to
      the detective to be used as soon as Mr. Lincoln was lodged in the car. Mr.
      Lincoln approved of the plan, and signified his readiness to acquiesce.
      Then Mr. Judd, forgetting the secrecy which the spy had so impressively
      enjoined, told Mr. Lincoln that the step he was about to take was one of
      such transcendent importance, that he thought "it should be communicated
      to the other gentlemen of the party." Mr. Lincoln said, "You can do as you
      like about that." Mr. Judd now changed his seat; and Mr. Nicolay, whose
      suspicions seem to have been aroused by this mysterious conference, sat
      down beside him, and said, "Judd, there is something up. What is it, if it
      is proper that I should know?"&mdash;"George," answered Judd, "there is no
      necessity for your knowing it. One man can keep a matter better than two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Harrisburg, and the public ceremonies and speech-making over,
      Mr. Lincoln retired to a private parlor in the Jones House; and Mr. Judd
      summoned to meet him Judge Davis, Col. Lamon, Col. Sumner, Major Hunter,
      and Capt. Pope. The three latter were officers of the regular army, and
      had joined the party after it had left Springfield. Judd began the
      conference by stating the alleged fact of the Baltimore conspiracy, how it
      was detected, and how it was proposed to thwart it by a midnight
      expedition to Washington by way of Philadelphia. It was a great surprise
      to most of those assembled. Col. Sumner was the first to break silence.
      "That proceeding," said he, "will be a damned piece of cowardice." Mr.
      Judd considered this a "pointed hit," but replied that "that view of the
      case had already been presented to Mr. Lincoln." Then there was a general
      interchange of opinions, which Sumner interrupted by saying, "I'll get a
      squad of cavalry, sir, and <i>cut</i> our way to Washington, sir!"&mdash;"Probably
      before that day comes," said Mr. Judd, "the inauguration day will have
      passed. It is important that Mr. Lincoln should be in Washington that
      day." Thus far Judge Davis had expressed no opinion, but "had put various
      questions to test the truthfulness of the story." He now turned to Mr.
      Lincoln, and said, "You personally heard the detective's story. You have
      heard this discussion. What is your judgment in the matter?"&mdash;"I have
      listened," answered Mr. Lincoln, "to this discussion with interest. I see
      no reason, no good reason, to change the programme; and I am for carrying
      it out as arranged by Judd." There was no longer any dissent as to the
      plan itself; but one question still remained to be disposed of. Who should
      accompany the President on his perilous ride? Mr. Judd again took the
      lead, declaring that he and Mr. Lincoln had previously determined that but
      one man ought to go, and that Col. Lamon had been selected as the proper
      person. To this Sumner violently demurred. "<i>I</i> have undertaken," he
      exclaimed, "to see Mr. Lincoln to Washington."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln was hastily dining when a close carriage was brought to the
      side-door of the hotel. He was called, hurried to his room, changed his
      coat and hat, and passed rapidly through the hall and out of the door. As
      he was stepping into the carriage, it became manifest that Sumner was
      determined to get in also. "Hurry with him," whispered Judd to Lamon, and
      at the same time, placing his hand on Sumner's shoulder, said aloud, "One
      moment, colonel!" Sumner turned around; and, in that moment, the carriage
      drove rapidly away. "A madder man," says Mr. Judd, "you never saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln and Col. Lamon got on board the car without discovery or
      mishap. Besides themselves, there was no one in or about the car but Mr.
      Lewis, general superintendent of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad, and
      Mr. Franciscus, superintendent of the division over which they were about
      to pass. As Mr. Lincoln's dress on this occasion has been much discussed,
      it may be as well to state that he wore a soft, light felt hat, drawn down
      over his face when it seemed necessary or convenient, and a shawl thrown
      over his shoulders, and pulled up to assist in disguising his features
      when passing to and from the carriage. This was all there was of the
      "Scotch cap and cloak," so widely celebrated in the political literature
      of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock they reached Philadelphia, and were met by the detective,
      and one Mr. Kinney, an under-official of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and
      Baltimore Railroad. Lewis and Franciscus bade Mr. Lincoln adieu. Mr.
      Lincoln, Col. Lamon, and the detective seated themselves in a carriage,
      which stood in waiting, and Mr. Kinney got upon the box with the driver.
      It was a full hour and a half before the Baltimore train was to start; and
      Mr. Kinney found it necessary "to consume the time by driving northward in
      search of some imaginary person."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way through Philadelphia, Mr. Lincoln told his companions about the
      message he had received from Mr. Seward. This new discovery was infinitely
      more appalling than the other. Mr. Seward had been informed "that about <i>fifteen
      thousand men</i> were organized to prevent his (Lincoln's) passage through
      Baltimore, and that arrangements were made by these parties <i>to blow up
      the railroad track, fire the train.</i>" &amp;c. In view of these
      unpleasant circumstances, Mr. Seward recommended a change of route. Here
      was a plot big enough to swallow up the little one, which we are to regard
      as the peculiar property of Mr. Felton's detective. Hilliard, Ferrandina,
      and Luckett disappear among the "fifteen thousand;" and their maudlin and
      impotent twaddle about the "abolition tyrant" looks very insignificant
      beside the bloody massacre, conflagration, and explosion now foreshadowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the moment for the departure of the Baltimore train drew near, the
      carriage paused in the dark shadows of the dépôt building. It was not
      considered prudent to approach the entrance. The spy passed in first, and
      was followed by Mr. Lincoln and Col. Lamon. An agent of the former
      directed them to the sleeping-car, which they entered by the rear door.
      Mr. Kinney ran forward, and delivered to the conductor the "important
      package" prepared for the purpose; and in three minutes the train was in
      motion. The tickets for the whole party had been procured beforehand.
      Their berths were ready, but had only been preserved from invasion by the
      statement, that they were retained for a sick man and his attendants. The
      business had been managed very adroitly by the female spy, who had
      accompanied her employer from Baltimore to Philadelphia to assist him in
      this the most delicate and important affair of his life. Mr. Lincoln got
      into his bed immediately; and the curtains were drawn together. When the
      conductor came around, the detective handed him the "sick man's" ticket;
      and the rest of the party lay down also. None of "our party appeared to be
      sleepy," says the detective; "but we all lay quiet, and nothing of
      importance transpired." "Mr. Lincoln is very homely," said the woman in
      her "report," "and so very tall, that he could not lay straight in his
      berth." During the night Mr. Lincoln indulged in a joke or two, in an
      undertone; but, with that exception, the "two sections" occupied by them
      were perfectly silent. The detective said he had men stationed at various
      places along the road to let him know "if all was right;" and he rose and
      went to the platform occasionally to observe their signals, but returned
      each time with a favorable report.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirty minutes after three, the train reached Baltimore. One of the
      spy's assistants came on board, and informed him "in a whisper that all
      was right." The woman got out of the car. Mr. Lincoln lay close in his
      berth; and in a few moments the car was being slowly drawn through the
      quiet streets of the city toward the Washington dépôt. There again there
      was another pause, but no sound more alarming than the noise of shifting
      cars and engines. The passengers, tucked away on their narrow shelves,
      dozed on as peacefully as if Mr. Lincoln had never been born, until they
      were awakened by the loud strokes of a huge club against a
      night-watchman's box, which stood within the dépôt and close to the track.
      It was an Irishman, trying to arouse a sleepy ticket-agent, comfortably
      ensconced within. For twenty minutes the Irishman pounded the box with
      ever-increasing vigor, and, at each report of his blows, shouted at the
      top of his voice, "Captain! it's four o'clock! it's four o'clock!" The
      Irishman seemed to think that time had ceased to run at four o'clock, and,
      making no allowance for the period consumed by his futile exercises,
      repeated to the last his original statement that it was four o'clock. The
      passengers were intensely amused; and their jokes and laughter at the
      Irishman's expense were not lost upon the occupants of the "two sections"
      in the rear. "Mr. Lincoln," says the detective, appeared "to enjoy it very
      much, and made several witty remarks, showing that he was as full of fun
      as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time the train sped out of the suburbs of Baltimore; and the
      apprehensions of the President and his friends diminished with each
      welcome revolution of the wheels. At six o'clock the dome of the Capitol
      came in sight; and a moment later they rolled into the long, unsightly
      building, which forms the Washington dépôt. They passed out of the car
      unobserved, and pushed along with the living stream of men and women
      toward the outer door. One man alone in the great crowd seemed to watch
      Mr. Lincoln with special attention. Standing a little on one side, he
      "looked very sharp at him," and, as he passed, seized hold of his hand,
      and said in a loud tone of voice, "Abe, you can't play that on me." The
      detective and Col. Lamon were instantly alarmed. One of them raised his
      fist to strike the stranger; but Mr. Lincoln caught his arm, and said,
      "Don't strike him! don't strike him! It is Washburne. Don't you know him?"
      Mr. Seward had given to Mr. Washburne a hint of the information received
      through his son; and Mr. Washburne knew its value as well as another. For
      the present, the detective admonished him to keep quiet; and they passed
      on together. Taking a hack, they drove towards Willard's Hotel. Mr.
      Lincoln, Mr. Washburne, and the detectives got out in the street, and
      approached the ladies' entrance; while Col. Lamon drove on to the main
      entrance, and sent the proprietor to meet his distinguished guest at the
      side door. A few minutes later Mr. Seward arrived, and was introduced to
      the company by Mr. Washburne. He spoke in very strong terms of the great
      danger which Mr. Lincoln had so narrowly escaped, and most heartily
      applauded the wisdom of the "secret passage." "I informed Gov. Seward of
      the nature of the information I had," says the detective, "and that I had
      no information of any large organization in Baltimore; but the Governor
      reiterated that he had conclusive evidence of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became apparent that Mr. Lincoln wished to be left alone. He said
      he was "rather tired;" and, upon this intimation, the party separated. The
      detective went to the telegraph-office, and loaded the wires with
      despatches, containing the pleasing intelligence that "Plums" had brought
      "Nuts" through in safety. In the spy's cipher the President elect was
      reduced to the undignified title of "Nuts."
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day Mr. Lincoln's family and suite passed through Baltimore on
      the special train intended for him. They saw no sign of any disposition to
      burn them alive, or to blow them up with gunpowder, but went their way
      unmolested and very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lincoln soon learned to regret the midnight ride. His friends
      reproached him, his enemies taunted him. He was convinced that he had
      committed a grave mistake in yielding to the solicitations of a
      professional spy and of friends too easily alarmed. He saw that he had
      fled from a danger purely imaginary, and felt the shame and mortification
      natural to a brave man under such circumstances. But he was not disposed
      to take all the responsibility to himself, and frequently upbraided the
      writer for having aided and assisted him to demean himself at the very
      moment in all his life when his behavior should have exhibited the utmost
      dignity and composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of his surreptitious entry into Washington occasioned much and
      varied comment throughout the country; but important events followed it in
      such rapid succession, that its real significance was soon lost sight of.
      Enough that Mr. Lincoln was safely at the capital, and in a few days would
      in all probability assume the power confided to his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      If before leaving Springfield he had become weary of the pressure upon him
      for office, he found no respite on his arrival at the focus of political
      intrigue and corruption. The intervening days before his inauguration were
      principally occupied in arranging the construction of his Cabinet. He was
      pretty well determined on this subject before he reached Washington; but
      in the minds of the public, beyond the generally accepted fact, that Mr.
      Seward was to be the Premier of the new administration, all was
      speculation and conjecture. From the circumstances of the case, he was
      compelled to give patient ear to the representations which were made him
      in favor of or against various persons or parties, and to hold his final
      decisions till the last moment, in order that he might decide with a full
      view of the requirements of public policy and party fealty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The close of this volume is not the place to enter into a detailed history
      of the circumstances which attended the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln's
      administration, nor of the events which signalized the close of Mr.
      Buchanan's. The history of the former cannot be understood without tracing
      its relation to that of the latter, and both demand more impartial
      consideration than either has yet received.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 4th of March, 1861, at last arrived; and at noon on that day the
      administration of James Buchanan was to come to a close, and that of
      Abraham Lincoln was to take its place. Mr. Lincoln's feelings, as the hour
      approached which was to invest him with greater responsibilities than had
      fallen upon any of his predecessors, may readily be imagined by the
      readers of the foregoing pages. If he saw in his elevation another step
      towards the fulfilment of that destiny which at times he believed awaited
      him, the thought served but to tinge with a peculiar, almost poetic
      sadness, the manner in which he addressed himself to the solemn duties of
      the hour.

      The morning opened pleasantly. At an early hour he gave his inaugural
      address its final revision. Extensive preparations had been made to render
      the occasion as impressive as possible. By nine o'clock the procession had
      begun to form, and at eleven o'clock it commenced to move toward Willard's
      Hotel. Mr. Buchanan was still at the Capitol, signing bills till the
      official term of his office expired. At half-past twelve he called for Mr.
      Lincoln; and, after a delay of a few moments, both descended, and entered
      the open barouche in waiting for them. Shortly after, the procession took
      up its line of march for the Capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apprehensions existed, that possibly some attempt might be made to
      assassinate Mr. Lincoln; and accordingly his carriage was carefully
      surrounded by the military and the Committee of Arrangements. By order of
      Gen. Scott, troops were placed at various points about the city, as well
      as on the tops of some of the houses along the route of the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senate remained in session till twelve o'clock, when Mr. Breckinridge,
      in a few well-chosen words, bade the senators farewell, and then conducted
      his successor, Mr. Hamlin, to the chair. At this moment, members and
      members elect of the House of Representatives, and the Diplomatic Corps,
      entered the chamber. At thirteen minutes to one, the Judges of the Supreme
      Court were announced; and on their entrance, headed by the venerable
      Chief-Justice Taney, all on the floor arose, while they moved slowly to
      the seats assigned them at the right of the Vice-President, bowing to that
      officer as they passed. At fifteen minutes past one, the Marshal-in-Chief
      entered the chamber ushering in the President and President elect. Mr.
      Lincoln looked pale, and wan, and anxious. In a few moments, the Marshal
      led the way to the platform at the eastern portico of the Capitol, where
      preparations had been made for the inauguration ceremony; and he was
      followed by the Judges of the Supreme Court, Sergeant-at-Arms of the
      Senate, the Committee of Arrangements, the President and President elect,
      Vice-President, Secretary of the Senate, Senators, Diplomatic Corps, Heads
      of Departments, and others in the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the platform, Mr. Lincoln was introduced to the assembly,
      by the Hon. E. D. Baker, United States Senator from Oregon. Stepping
      forward, in a manner deliberate and impressive, he read in a clear,
      penetrating voice, the following
    </p>
    <p>
      INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fellow-Citizens of the United States:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear
      before you to address you briefly, and to take, in your presence, the oath
      prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the
      President before he enters on the execution of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those
      matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or
      excitement. Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern
      States, that, by the accession of a Republican administration, their
      property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There
      has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the
      most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been
      open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches
      of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches,
      when I declare, that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to
      interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists."
      I believe I have no lawful right to do so; and I have no inclination to do
      so. Those who nominated and elected me did so with the full knowledge that
      I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted
      them. And, more than this, they placed in the platform, for my acceptance,
      and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution
      which I now read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and
      especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic
      institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to
      that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our
      political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed
      force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext,
      as among the gravest of crimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon the
      public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is
      susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to
      be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the
      Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all
      the States, when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause, as cheerfully to
      one section as to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from
      service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the
      Constitution as any other of its provisions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof,
      escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation
      therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered
      up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who
      made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the
      intention of the lawgiver is the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution,&mdash;to
      this provision as well as any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves
      whose cases come within the terms of this clause "shall be delivered up,"
      their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good
      temper, could they not, with nearly equal unanimity, frame and pass a law
      by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced
      by national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a
      very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but
      little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done; and
      should any one in any case be content that this oath shall go unkept on a
      merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of
      liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so
      that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it
      not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that
      clause in the Constitution which guarantees that "the citizens of each
      State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens
      in the several States"?
    </p>
    <p>
      I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no
      purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules;
      and, while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as
      proper to be enforced, I do suggest, that it will be much safer for all,
      both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all
      those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting
      to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under
      our national Constitution. During that period, fifteen different and very
      distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive
      branch of the government. They have conducted it through many perils, and
      generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope for precedent, I
      now enter upon the same task, for the brief constitutional term of four
      years, under great and peculiar difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now
      formidably attempted. I hold, that, in the contemplation of universal law
      and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.
      Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all
      national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever
      had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to
      execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and the
      Union will endure forever; it being impossible to destroy it, except by
      some action not provided for in the instrument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association
      of States in the nature of a contract merely, can it, as a contract, be
      peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a
      contract may violate it,&mdash;break it, so to speak; but does it not
      require all to lawfully rescind it? Descending from these general
      principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union
      is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by
      the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued in the
      Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith
      of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it
      should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation, in 1778; and,
      finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and
      establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union. But, if
      the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be
      lawfully possible, the Union is less than before, the Constitution having
      lost the vital element of perpetuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can
      lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect
      are legally void; and that acts of violence within any State or States
      against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or
      revolutionary according to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore consider, that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the
      Union is unbroken; and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as
      the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the
      Union shall be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this, which I
      deem to be only a simple duty on my part, I shall perfectly perform it, so
      far as is practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people,
      shall withhold the requisite power, or in some authoritative manner direct
      the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared
      purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be
      none unless it is forced upon the national authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power confided to me <i>will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the
      property and places belonging to the government</i>, and collect the
      duties and imposts; but, beyond what may be necessary for these objects,
      there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where hostility to the United States shall be so great and so universal as
      to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices,
      there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for
      that object. While the strict legal right may exist of the Government to
      enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so
      irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to
      forego for the time the uses of such offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of
      the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect
      security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course here indicated will be followed, unless current events and
      experience shall show a modification or change to be proper; and in every
      case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to the
      circumstances actually existing, and with a view and hope of a peaceful
      solution of the national troubles, and the restoration of fraternal
      sympathies and affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there are persons, in one section or another, who seek to destroy the
      Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither
      affirm nor deny. But, if there be such, I need address no word to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak? Before
      entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric,
      with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be well
      to ascertain why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while any
      portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while
      the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly
      from? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? All profess to
      be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is
      it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has
      been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constituted, that
      no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written
      provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If, by the mere force
      of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written
      constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify
      revolution: it certainly would, if such right were a vital one. But such
      is not our case.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly
      assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and
      prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise
      concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision
      specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical
      administration. No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of
      reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions.
      Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by National or by State
      authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect
      slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. From
      questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and
      we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government
      must cease. There is no alternative for continuing the government but
      acquiescence on the one side or the other. If a minority, in such a case,
      will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn
      will ruin and divide them; for a minority of their own will secede from
      them, whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority. For
      instance, why not any portion of a new confederacy, a year or two hence,
      arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now
      claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being
      educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity
      of interests among the States to compose a new Union as to produce harmony
      only, and prevent renewed secession? Plainly, the central idea of
      secession is the essence of anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A majority held in restraint by constitutional check and limitation, and
      always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and
      sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects
      it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is
      impossible: the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly
      inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or
      despotism in some form is all that is left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional
      questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such
      decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit, as to
      the object of that suit; while they are also entitled to very high respect
      and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the
      government; and, while it is obviously possible that such decision may be
      erroneous in any given case, still, the evil effect following it, being
      limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled
      and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than
      could the evils of a different practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the candid citizen must confess, that, if the policy of
      the government upon the vital questions affecting the whole people is to
      be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme Court the instant
      they are made, as in ordinary litigation between parties in personal
      actions, the people will have ceased to be their own masters, having to
      that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that
      eminent tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is
      a duty from which they may not shrink, to decide cases properly brought
      before them; and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their
      decisions to political purposes. One section of our country believes
      slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is
      wrong and ought not to be extended; and this is the only substantial
      dispute: and the fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law
      for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,
      perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of
      the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the
      people abide by the dry, legal obligation in both cases, and a few break
      over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be
      worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The
      foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately
      revived, without restriction, in one section; while fugitive slaves, now
      only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically speaking, we cannot separate: we cannot remove our respective
      sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A
      husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond
      the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do
      this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either
      amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to
      make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after
      separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can
      make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than
      laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always;
      and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease
      fighting, the identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again
      upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.
      Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can
      exercise their constitutional right of amending, or their revolutionary
      right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact, that
      many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national
      Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendment, I fully
      recognize the full authority of the people over the whole subject, to be
      exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and
      I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair
      opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will venture to add, that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in
      that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead
      of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by
      others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be
      precisely such as they would wish either to accept or refuse. I understand
      that a proposed amendment to the Constitution (which amendment, however, I
      have not seen) has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal
      Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of States,
      including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of
      what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular
      amendments so far as to say, that, holding such a provision to now be
      implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express
      and irrevocable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they
      have conferred none upon him to fix the terms for the separation of the
      States. The people themselves, also, can do this if they choose; but the
      Executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer
      the present government as it came to his hands, and to transmit it
      unimpaired by him to his successor. Why should there not be a patient
      confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or
      equal hope in the world? In our present differences, is either party
      without faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of nations,
      with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on
      yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the
      judgment of this great tribunal,&mdash;the American people. By the frame
      of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given
      their public servants but little power for mischief, and have with equal
      wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very
      short intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no
      administration, by any extreme wickedness or folly, can very seriously
      injure the Government in the short space of four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject.
      Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be an object to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to a step which
      you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by
      taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution
      unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing
      under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it
      would, to change either.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in
      the dispute, there is still no single reason for precipitate action.
      Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has
      never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in
      the best way, all our present difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the
      momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You can
      have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government; while I shall
      have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend" it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am loah to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be
      enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and
      patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad
      land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as
      surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This address, so characteristic of its author, and so full of the best
      qualities of Mr. Lincoln's nature, was well received by the large audience
      which heard it. Having finished, Mr. Lincoln turned to Chief-Justice
      Taney, who, with much apparent agitation and emotion, administered to him
      the following oath:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, Abraham Lincoln, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the
      office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my
      ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
      States."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony concluded, Mr. Lincoln, as President of the United States, in
      charge of the Committee of Arrangements, was accompanied by Mr. Buchanan
      back to the Senate- Chamber, and from there to the Executive Mansion. Here
      Mr. Buchanan took leave of him, invoking upon his administration a
      peaceful and happy result; and here for the present we leave him. In
      another volume we shall endeavor to trace his career as the nation's Chief
      Magistrate during the ensuing four years.

      THE circumstances under which the original of the accompanying <i>facsimile</i>
      was written are explained in the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      National Hotel, Washington, D.C., Feb. 19, 1872. Colonel Ward H. Lamon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;In compliance with your request, I place in your hands a
      copy of a manuscript in my possession written by Abraham Lincoln, giving a
      brief account of his early history, and the commencement of that political
      career which terminated in his election to the Presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be inappropriate to say, that some time preceding the writing
      of the enclosed, finding, in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, a laudable
      curiosity in the public mind to know more about the early history of Mr.
      Lincoln, and looking, too, to the possibilities of his being an available
      candidate for the Presidency in 1860, I had on several occasions requested
      of him this information, and that it was not without some hesitation he
      placed in my hands even this very modest account of himself, which he did
      in the month of December, 1859.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this were added, by myself, other facts bearing upon his legislative
      and political history, and the whole forwarded to a friend residing in my
      native county (Chester, Pa.),&mdash;the Hon. Joseph J. Lewis, former
      Commissioner of Internal Revenue,&mdash;who made them the basis of an
      ably-written and somewhat elaborate memoir of the late President, which
      appeared in the Pennsylvania and other papers of the country in January,
      1860, and which contributed to prepare the way for the subsequent
      nomination at Chicago the following June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing this brief and unpretending narrative, written by himself in his
      own peculiar vein,&mdash;and injustice to him I should add, without the
      remotest expectation of its ever appearing in public,&mdash;with the
      attending circumstances, may be of interest to the numerous admirers of
      that historic and truly great man, I place it at your disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesse W. Fell.
